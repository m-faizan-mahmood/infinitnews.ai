In a surprise move, Canadian rapper Drake has reignited the flames of his longstanding feud with Kendrick Lamar, choosing to address the controversy during a live stream on Kick alongside popular gamer xQc. The high-stakes exchange has sent shockwaves across the rap community, with fans and critics alike eagerly dissecting the rapper's scathing remarks.

During the stream, Drake made a pointed statement, saying, ""You need facts to take me out, fairytales won't do it."" The comment has been widely interpreted as a direct shot at Lamar, whose recent album GNX has been making waves online. This marks one of Drake's first public comments since the two rappers' heated exchanges earlier this year, when Lamar emerged triumphant with his track ""Not Like Us"" and a victory lap at The Pop Out show.

Drake's timing is particularly noteworthy, coming just a day after Lamar's album release. The rapper's decision to engage in a public spat with Lamar has once again put the spotlight on their long-standing feud, which has been a topic of discussion for years.

In the stream, Drake remained cryptic, refusing to elaborate on his comments and instead reiterating that ""nothing phases me"" and only facts can affect him. This stance has led some to speculate that Drake is attempting to assert his dominance over Lamar, while others see it as a sign of frustration and insecurity.

The beef between Drake and Lamar has been well-documented, with both rappers trading bars and diss tracks over the years. However, this latest exchange marks a significant escalation in the feud, as both parties have taken to social media to trade blows.

So, what does this mean for the future of the rap world? Will Drake's bold statement lead to a new wave of diss tracks and verbal sparring, or is this the beginning of a new era of collaboration and respect? Only time will tell.

**The Context: A Brief History of the Feud**

For the uninitiated, the beef between Drake and Lamar began in the early 2010s, when both rappers were rising stars in the hip-hop world. The tension between them simmered for years, with both parties trading barbs and subtle digs in their music.

The feud reached a boiling point in 2022, when Lamar released ""Not Like Us,"" a scathing diss track aimed directly at Drake. The song was a massive hit, and Lamar's victory lap at The Pop Out show cemented his status as the winner of the battle.

Drake, however, remained silent on the matter, choosing to let the dust settle before making his next move. And now, with his latest comments on the Kick stream, it seems that he's ready to take the fight back to Lamar.

**The Implications: A Changing Landscape for Hip-Hop**

For fans, the drama has been a thrilling spectacle, with both sides trading blows and providing endless fuel for debate and discussion. For the artists themselves, the feud has raised the stakes, pushing them to create some of their best work.

K-P Information Minister Muhammad Ali Saif said in a statement that a government delegation flew in to Parachinar, Kurram's main town, and met with the rival leaders on Saturday and Sunday to try to broker a ceasefire deal and then move to resolve the matter. The government Jirga had returned to Peshawar from Kurram and ""there have been positive developments in engagements with stakeholders,"" Saif said. ""Both sides have agreed to a ceasefire for seven days and return each other's prisoners and bodies,"" he added. Armed groups in Kurram have been engaged in tribal rivalry for decades over a land dispute in the district located near the Afghanistan border. The latest wave of clashes was triggered after gunmen attacked convoys of civilian vehicles on Thursday, killing dozens of passengers. The roadside pogrom sparked retaliatory attacks against local residents and there have been pitched battles between armed groups from both sides. Armed groups attacked settlements that were populated by members of rival groups. According to the latest information obtained from the local police sources, 12 more people were killed in firing incidents in the district overnight, raising the death toll from clashes to 31 in the last 24 hours, and to 75 in the last three days. However, other media reports put the death toll even higher. ""The clashes and convoy attacks on November 21, 22, and 23 have resulted in 82 fatalities and 156 injuries,"" a local administration official told AFP, while speaking on condition of anonymity. Last night, clashes continued in Bagan, Alizai, Balshakhel, Khar Kalay, Maqbal and Kunj Alizai. The fighting intensified when armed groups of the Turi tribe burned and looted the Lower Kurram villages of Kalu Kunj, Badshah Kot and Bagan Bazaar. In the district, many homes had been evacuated, while markets and schools remain closed. A number of petrol stations had also been set alight, the officials said, adding that gunfights with both light and heavy weapons continued into the night. However, no fresh casualties were reported on Sunday morning. ""The mobile network across Kurram remains suspended and traffic on the main highway is halted,"" said another official. ""Our priority today is to broker a ceasefire between both sides. Once that is achieved, we can begin addressing the underlying issues,"" K-P Law Minister Aftab Alam Afridi told AFP.

In a significant breakthrough, the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) government Jirga has successfully brokered a ceasefire deal between warring tribesmen in the Kurram district, marking a crucial step towards resolving the decades-old land dispute that has led to violence and bloodshed (1). The agreement, which was reached after intense negotiations between government officials and rival leaders, includes a seven-day ceasefire, the return of prisoners, and the exchange of bodies (2).

The violence in Kurram, which has resulted in 82 fatalities and 156 injuries, according to local administration officials, was triggered by a series of attacks on civilian convoys and retaliatory strikes against local residents (3). The clashes have also led to the displacement of many families, with markets, schools, and petrol stations in the district remaining shut (4).

The government Jirga, which consisted of provincial information minister Muhammad Ali Saif and law minister Aftab Alam Afridi, flew into Parachinar, the main town of Kurram district, to facilitate negotiations between the rival tribes (5). The delegation met with the leaders of the warring tribes and convinced them to agree to the ceasefire and the return of prisoners and bodies (6).

The K-P government has been attempting to resolve the Kurram issue for years, and the recent violence has put additional pressure on the administration to find a solution (7). The government has emphasized that the priority now is to maintain the ceasefire and address the underlying issues that have contributed to the violence (8).

The Kurram district has been plagued by tribal rivalry for decades, with the Turi tribe and the Zakhakhel tribe engaged in a bitter dispute over land ownership (9). The dispute has led to frequent clashes, which have resulted in the loss of many lives and the displacement of thousands of people (10).

The success of the government Jirga in brokering a ceasefire deal is a significant achievement, and it is hoped that the agreement will mark a turning point in the resolution of the Kurram issue (11). The K-P government has vowed to continue working towards a peaceful resolution of the dispute, and it is expected that the ceasefire will remain in place for the next seven days (12).

A recent surge in polio cases in Pakistan has raised concerns about the country's ability to contain the outbreak. The latest report from the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) confirms three new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), bringing the total number of cases to 55. This alarming development highlights the need for immediate action to protect the country's most vulnerable populations.

According to the report, the three new cases have emerged from DI Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Zhob and Jaffarabad districts of Balochistan. The affected individuals are a female child in DI Khan and Zhob, and a male child in Jaffarabad. DI Khan, one of the seven polio-endemic districts of southern K-P, has reported six cases so far this year, while Zhob has seen its third case this year and Jaffarabad its second.

Pakistan is currently grappling with an intense resurgence of WPV1, with 26 cases reported from Balochistan, 14 from K-P, 13 from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Islamabad. Polio, a paralyzing disease with no cure, requires multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five to provide high immunity against the disease.

The Pakistan Polio Programme conducts multiple mass vaccination drives throughout the year, bringing the vaccine to children at their doorsteps. The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) also provides vaccinations against 12 childhood diseases free of charge at health facilities every year. However, considering the intense polio outbreak, it is crucial for parents to ensure vaccination for all their children under the age of five to keep them protected.

**Experts Weigh In on the Crisis**

Dr. Muhammad Safdar, a renowned epidemiologist, emphasizes the importance of increasing vaccination rates, particularly in high-risk areas. ""The polio outbreak in Pakistan is a wake-up call for the government and healthcare authorities to intensify their efforts to contain the spread of the disease,"" he said. ""We need to focus on improving vaccination coverage, especially in areas with low immunization rates.""

Dr. Aliya Khan, a leading public health expert, agrees that the crisis requires a multifaceted approach. ""The government needs to work closely with healthcare providers, community leaders, and parents to ensure that every child is vaccinated. We also need to strengthen surveillance systems to quickly identify and respond to new cases.""

**What Can Be Done to Combat the Outbreak?**

To combat the polio outbreak, the government, healthcare authorities, and community leaders must work together to:

1. Increase vaccination rates: Especially in high-risk areas, vaccination coverage needs to be improved to prevent the spread of the disease.
2. Strengthen surveillance systems: Early detection and response to new cases are crucial in containing the outbreak.
3. Improve access to healthcare: Parents must have access to healthcare facilities and vaccination services, particularly in remote areas.
4. Increase awareness: Public awareness campaigns must be launched to educate parents and communities about the importance of vaccination and the risks associated with polio.

**Conclusion**

The recent surge in polio cases in Pakistan is a stark reminder of the ongoing challenge to eradicate the disease. To combat this outbreak, it is essential to work together to improve vaccination rates, strengthen surveillance systems, improve access to healthcare, and increase awareness. By taking these steps, we can protect the country's most vulnerable populations and ultimately eradicate polio from Pakistan.

Following a visit to Islamabad, a top Chinese diplomat dealing with Afghanistan travelled to Kabul over the weekend to meet with the Taliban leadership. China's Special Envoy for Afghanistan Yue Xiaoyong held talks with Afghan Deputy Prime Minister for Political Affairs Maulvi Abdul Kabir, Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub and others. His visit to Kabul came days after he was briefed by authorities in Islamabad on the threat posed by the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other militant groups operating from Afghan soil. Sources said Pakistan conveyed to the envoy that without addressing the terror threat, bilateral relations with Kabul would not move forward. It is believed that the visit of the Chinese envoy to Kabul and Islamabad was part of Beijing's latest push to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. China has in the past attempted to mediate between the estranged countries on the TTP issue, though those efforts yielded no progress. Beijing is worried about the fallout of escalating Pakistan-Afghanistan hostilities on its regional ambitions for greater connectivity and trade. Besides, the persistent presence of terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan also threatens Beijing's interests. Chinese nationals have come under terror attacks in Pakistan. This year at least 7 Chinese nationals were killed in two different terrorist attacks. Pakistan's investigations into the March 26 Besham terrorist attack concluded that there was a network connected to TTP was behind the attack. The probe also revealed that the suicide bomber was an Afghan national and the vehicle used in the attack was smuggled into Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan believes Baloch terrorist groups are now closely working with the TTP and also have their training camps in Afghanistan. However, unlike other countries, China usually follows a carefully crafted policy where such concerns are conveyed from behind closed doors. Officials here believe that they have this understanding that the Chinese envoy forcefully raised the issue of terrorist sanctuaries with the Afghan leadership. A statement issued by the Afghan Deputy Prime Minister's Office indicated that Pakistan, and Afghanistan relationship was one of the subjects of discussions. According to the statement, Mr Yue Xiaoyong commended Afghanistan's progress over the past three years and stressed the significance of fostering improved relations and mutual understanding among Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China. The reference to Pakistan, Afghanistan and China, according to observers, shows that Beijing is keen to see issues between Islamabad and Kabul are sorted out. The Afghan deputy prime minister told the Chinese envoy that the Islamic Emirate has consistently guaranteed its neighbours and the international community that Afghanistan poses no threat to any nation and has upheld this assurance over the past three years. ""The Deputy Prime Minister further noted that Afghanistan is transitioning from a prolonged period of conflict and is prioritizing the revitalisation of its national economy and the expansion of regional cooperation,"" according to the readout, which suggests that the Afghan side tried to placate concerns of China and Pakistan.

This warning comes as a stark reminder of the persistent threat posed by these terrorist groups, which have been linked to several attacks in Pakistan, including the March 26 Besham terrorist attack that killed 7 Chinese nationals.

China's diplomatic effort to defuse tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan is seen as a crucial step towards promoting regional stability and security. The country has long been a key player in the region, and its efforts to mediate between the two estranged countries on the TTP issue have yielded no progress in the past. However, with Beijing's regional ambitions for greater connectivity and trade at stake, it is imperative that China continues to play a key role in resolving this long-standing issue.

With China's regional ambitions for greater connectivity and trade at stake, it is clear that Beijing will continue to play a key role in resolving this long-standing issue.

The directive came on Sunday during a consultative session held in Lahore attended by NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan. According to officials, the participants reviewed the current political situation while also discussing the PPP's grievances as well as the PTI's protest march which left for Islamabad on Sunday, raising concerns about potential political instability. On November 22, PM Shehbaz established an 11-member committee after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari voiced frustration over the PML-N leadership's approach to coalition governance. The committee, including Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, and Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Khan Cheema, was tasked with facilitating ""political cooperation and conflict resolution"" between the parties. According to a statement issued from the PM's Office, the committee would work with PPP representatives to outline a path forward through dialogue. Earlier, on Saturday, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, who belongs to the PPP, urged the PM to intervene in order to resolve the differences between the two parties, which have a long history of political confrontation. During his meeting with Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar, the governor had also urged the PML-N led Punjab government to honor its commitment with the PPP, stating that the committee formed by the two parties to resolve issues have yielded no results. Khan said a functional coalition between the PML-N and the PPP would be beneficial for the country, warning that if the coalition government fails, it would primarily harm the PML-N, which currently leads the government. Last week, Bilawal had criticized the PML-N led federal government for failing to honor commitments to the PPP. He alleged that the PML-N government had not consulted with the PPP on policy matters such as the recent crackdown against the Virtual Private Networks (VPNs and restrictions imposed on internet access. He had also expressed concern about the proposed amendments to the IRSA Act to pave the way for construction of more canals on the River Indus.

In a bid to address the long-standing concerns of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and strengthen the coalition government, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has instructed the speakers of the National Assembly and Punjab provincial assembly to take concrete steps to resolve the issues. This development comes amidst growing tensions between the PPP and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led government, which has been propped up by the former without it formally joining the coalition.

According to sources, the prime minister held a consultative session with the National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan in Lahore, where they reviewed the current political situation and discussed the PPP's grievances. The meeting was reportedly attended by senior government officials, including Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, and Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Khan Cheema.

The PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had previously expressed frustration over the PML-N leadership's approach to coalition governance, leading Prime Minister Shehbaz to establish an 11-member committee to facilitate ""political cooperation and conflict resolution"" between the parties. The committee, which includes key ministers from the federal cabinet, was tasked with working with PPP representatives to outline a path forward through dialogue.

The PPP's concerns, which have been building for some time, center around the PML-N led government's failure to honor its commitments to the party. Bilawal had previously criticized the government for not consulting with the PPP on policy matters, including the recent crackdown against Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and restrictions imposed on internet access. He had also expressed concern about the proposed amendments to the IRSA Act, which would pave the way for the construction of more canals on the River Indus.

In a statement, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, who belongs to the PPP, urged Prime Minister Shehbaz to intervene and resolve the differences between the two parties. Haider Khan emphasized that a functional coalition between the PML-N and the PPP would be beneficial for the country, warning that if the coalition government fails, it would primarily harm the PML-N.

This development is significant, as the PPP's withdrawal from the coalition government could have far-reaching consequences for the country's political landscape. As the second-largest party in the National Assembly, the PPP's support is crucial for the PML-N led government to function effectively.

In a statement, the Prime Minister's Office emphasized that the committee would work with PPP representatives to outline a path forward through dialogue. The government is keen to address the PPP's concerns and strengthen the coalition government, which has been propped up by the party without it formally joining the coalition.

**Background:**

The PPP and the PML-N have a long history of political confrontation, dating back to the 1980s. Despite their differences, the two parties have collaborated on several occasions, including during the 1990s when the PPP and the PML-N formed a coalition government together.

In recent years, the PPP has been critical of the PML-N led government's handling of key issues, including the economy, governance, and foreign policy. The party has also expressed concerns about the government's failure to deliver on its election promises and its alleged attempts to undermine the PPP's political influence.

**Impact:**

The resolution of the PPP's concerns is crucial for the stability of the coalition government and the country's political landscape. If the PPP withdraws its support, it could lead to a political crisis and undermine the government's ability to function effectively.

The development also has implications for the country's economy, which has been struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The government's ability to address the PPP's concerns and strengthen the coalition government is critical for ensuring economic stability and attracting investment.

**Conclusion:**

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's directive to the speakers of the National Assembly and Punjab provincial assembly to address the PPP's concerns is a significant development in the country's political landscape. The resolution of the PPP's grievances is crucial for the stability of the coalition government and the country's political landscape. The government must work to address the PPP's concerns and strengthen the coalition government to ensure economic stability and attract investment.

""Imagine a cinematic scene set in a futuristic, high-tech parliament building, reminiscent of the grandeur of the European Union's Berlaymont Building. The setting sun casts a warm, golden light through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating the ornate chandeliers and sleek, modern architecture. The atmosphere is tense and urgent, as a group of esteemed leaders, dressed in formal attire, gather around a large, circular table.

The mood is one of gravitas and importance, as they deliberate on the pressing concerns of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and the future of their coalition government. The leaders' faces are etched with concern and determination, as they scrutinize documents and confer with one another.

In the background, a subtle haze of smoke or fog adds a sense of drama and foreboding, as if the weight of their decisions hangs precariously in the balance. The color palette is a blend of warm, earthy tones (beiges, siennas, and golds) and cool, metallic hues (chromes, silvers, and blues), evoking a sense of sophistication and modernity.

The scene is reminiscent of the cinematic works of filmmakers like Steven Spielberg, known for his use of dramatic lighting and tension-building narratives. The aesthetic is polished and refined, with a focus on capturing the nuances of human expression and the drama of the situation.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511742/defiant-pti-marchers-knock-on-capital-door,Defiant PTI marchers knock on capital door,"November 25, 2024","PK Clashes reported from Attock bridge  hundreds arrested The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) embarked on a collision course with the government on Sunday as it finally started marching toward the federal capital after refusing to call off the 'final' protest call given by the imprisoned party founder Imran Khan for his release, among other things. The routes leading to the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi have been closed with containers and heavy contingents of the law-enforcement agencies (LEA) personnel were deployed to meet any eventuality. The PTI rallies from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) led by Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, as well as from different cities of Punjab, began advancing towards the D-Chowk ‚Äì located right in front of the Parliament House in the Red Zone of the federal capital. A large PTI procession from K-P entered Punjab from the Attock bridge, Chach Interchange and Ghazi Barotha Canal. The convoy of vehicles stopped at Ghazi for a while, where Chief Minister Gandapur and Bushra Bibi, wife of Imran Khan, addressed the supporters urging them to move forward. When another convoy, coming from Haripur, reached the Attock Bridge, the police resorted to tear gas shelling. The protesters, meanwhile, set fire to the green belts around them, while a Suzuki van parked at Ghazi Bridge was also torched. A policeman was injured when directly hit by a motorcycle rider. The PTI, after entering Punjab, changed its strategy and directed the convoys coming from the Hazara Division, which had reached Taxila under the leadership of Omar Ayub, to join Gandapur-led convoy. Clashes were also reported from the Isakhel Interchange in Dera Ismail Khan. The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily¬óand denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised. He made it clear that no one would be allowed to disrupt the law and order in the capital, and that the administration, police, and LEAs were prepared to deal with any possible situation. He mentioned that Belarus president's visit was crucial in strengthening relationship between the two countries.

As the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) embarked on a defiant march toward Islamabad, the country was gripped by anxiety and uncertainty. The government, determined to maintain law and order, deployed heavy contingents of law-enforcement agencies (LEAs) to block the routes leading to the federal capital. The resulting clashes and arrests have left the nation wondering about the future of democracy in Pakistan.

According to sources, hundreds of PTI workers were arrested in Punjab alone, with reports suggesting that several leaders, including Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi, were taken into custody. The government, meanwhile, has imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and denied PTI permission to hold the protest.

The PTI, however, refused to back down, with Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur leading the march from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and urging supporters to press forward. Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers, urging them to move quickly and not retreat until their demands are met.

The PTI's demands, which include the release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy, and return of the allegedly ""stolen mandate,"" have been met with resistance from the government. The government has reiterated that it will not allow the protesters to enter Islamabad and has taken measures to restrict communication in areas with ""security concerns.""

The deployment of containers and LEAs has brought the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi to a standstill, with the blockade affecting several other cities in Punjab. The government's decision to shut down internet services in certain areas has also sparked concerns about the effectiveness of communication.

As the standoff continues, both sides remain steadfast in their positions. The PTI has vowed to continue its protest until its demands are met, while the government has promised to take strict action against ""miscreants"" and maintain public order.

The situation has sparked concerns about the future of democracy in Pakistan, with many analysts warning of a possible descent into chaos. The government's refusal to engage with the PTI has been criticized, with many calling for a peaceful resolution to the crisis.

In a related development, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko's visit to Pakistan has been seen as a significant development in the country's foreign policy. The visit has been touted as a move to strengthen relations between the two countries.
