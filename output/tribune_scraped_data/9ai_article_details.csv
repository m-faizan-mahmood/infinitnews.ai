The 30-year-old sprinter had hinted earlier this year at the Paris Olympics that she would step away after earning gold, silver, and bronze medals in relay events, contributing to Australia's most successful Summer Games campaign. In a statement confirming her retirement, McKeon expressed mixed emotions, saying, ""I will definitely miss it... It‚Äôs brought me many great relationships and shaped who I am."" However, she added, ""I‚Äôm ready for the next chapter of my life, which I‚Äôm excited for. I haven‚Äôt yet had the chance to fully reflect on everything."" McKeon‚Äôs Olympic journey began in Rio 2016, where she won her first gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay, alongside two relay silvers and a bronze in the 200m freestyle. Her performance at Tokyo 2021 cemented her legacy, with victories in the 100m and 50m freestyle sprints, two relay golds, and three bronze medals ‚Äì the largest medal haul by any athlete at those Games. Australia's swimming coach Rohan Taylor praised McKeon, calling her ""a great role model for younger athletes"" and highlighting her resilience. ""While everyone witnessed her grace, they couldn‚Äôt fully see how tough she is,"" Taylor remarked. Swimming Australia CEO and McKeon‚Äôs uncle, Rob Woodhouse, alongside Taylor, described her victory in the 100m freestyle in Tokyo as a career highlight. In a thrilling race, McKeon edged out Hong Kong‚Äôs Siobhan Haughey by just 0.31 seconds. ""It was one of the greatest races I‚Äôve ever seen,"" Woodhouse commented, also commending McKeon for mentoring younger swimmers. In addition to her six Olympic golds and five world titles, McKeon was part of relay teams that set eight world records, three of which still stand. Reflecting on her journey, McKeon recalled missing out on the London Olympics as a teenager but used that experience to inspire others. ""You have ups and downs, but you keep going and ticking the boxes,"" she said. ""I hope my story shows young athletes that I was once in their position ‚Äì dreaming of achieving something big.""

Baseball, deeply rooted in Taiwanese culture since its introduction during Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945), is among the nation's most beloved sports. The team secured a decisive 4-0 win against Japan in the final at Tokyo Dome on Sunday, sparking widespread celebrations across Taiwan. President Lai Ching-te praised the players in a phone call shared on Instagram, thanking them for bringing pride to Taiwan and showcasing the island‚Äôs achievements beyond its renowned semiconductor industry. Lai also announced that the team would be greeted at the presidential office following their arrival. Defence Minister Wellington Koo, who watched the match at home, described the victory as a historic moment, adding that the fighter jet salute was a fitting gesture to honour the team's achievement. Large crowds gathered in Taiwan to watch the final on outdoor screens, while businesses and restaurants marked the occasion with special discounts. Some companies, including Trend Micro, declared Monday a holiday in celebration. Taiwan participated in the championship under the name ""Chinese Taipei,"" a designation used in most international sporting events to sidestep political tensions with China, which claims the island as its territory. The naming issue has been a contentious topic in Taiwan, with some advocating for the use of ""Taiwan"" in international competitions. A 2018 referendum rejected such a proposal, citing fears that it could provoke China to block the island‚Äôs participation in global events. In Tokyo, Taiwanese fan Wang Ming-chang expressed hope for change, saying, ""Taiwan is our country, and we want to compete under the name of Taiwan in international events. That‚Äôs our ultimate goal."" COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511746/kurram-rivals-agree-to-cease-fire-for-7-days,Kurram rivals agree to cease fire for 7 days,"November 25, 2024","PK Govt Jirga brokers deal for return of prisoners and bodies An official Jirga on Sunday negotiated a ceasefire between the warring tribesmen in the Kurram district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), as the death toll from the three days of violence rose to 82, according to the officials in the provincial capital and the embattled district. K-P Information Minister Muhammad Ali Saif said in a statement that a government delegation flew in to Parachinar, Kurram's main town, and met with the rival leaders on Saturday and Sunday to try to broker a ceasefire deal and then move to resolve the matter. The government Jirga had returned to Peshawar from Kurram and ""there have been positive developments in engagements with stakeholders,"" Saif said. ""Both sides have agreed to a ceasefire for seven days and return each other's prisoners and bodies,"" he added. Armed groups in Kurram have been engaged in tribal rivalry for decades over a land dispute in the district located near the Afghanistan border. The latest wave of clashes was triggered after gunmen attacked convoys of civilian vehicles on Thursday, killing dozens of passengers. The roadside pogrom sparked retaliatory attacks against local residents and there have been pitched battles between armed groups from both sides. Armed groups attacked settlements that were populated by members of rival groups. According to the latest information obtained from the local police sources, 12 more people were killed in firing incidents in the district overnight, raising the death toll from clashes to 31 in the last 24 hours, and to 75 in the last three days. However, other media reports put the death toll even higher. ""The clashes and convoy attacks on November 21, 22, and 23 have resulted in 82 fatalities and 156 injuries,"" a local administration official told AFP, while speaking on condition of anonymity. Last night, clashes continued in Bagan, Alizai, Balshakhel, Khar Kalay, Maqbal and Kunj Alizai. The fighting intensified when armed groups of the Turi tribe burned and looted the Lower Kurram villages of Kalu Kunj, Badshah Kot and Bagan Bazaar. In the district, many homes had been evacuated, while markets and schools remain closed. A number of petrol stations had also been set alight, the officials said, adding that gunfights with both light and heavy weapons continued into the night. However, no fresh casualties were reported on Sunday morning. ""The mobile network across Kurram remains suspended and traffic on the main highway is halted,"" said another official. ""Our priority today is to broker a ceasefire between both sides. Once that is achieved, we can begin addressing the underlying issues,"" K-P Law Minister Aftab Alam Afridi told AFP.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511745/three-more-polio-cases-confirmed-1,Three more polio cases confirmed,"November 25, 2024","PK Three more polio cases confirmed In a troubling development, three more polio cases have emerged, taking the total number of polio cases reported so far in the country to 55. The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) has confirmed the detection of three wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases. These cases have emerged from DI Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Zhob and Jaffarabad districts of Balochistan. In DI Khan and Zhob, female children are affected while in Jaffarabad the crippling disease has attacked a male child. DI Khan, one of the seven polio endemic districts of southern K-P, has so far reported six polio cases, while this is the third case this year from Zhob and second from Jaffarabad. Pakistan is responding to an intense resurgence of WPV1 this year. Of the 55 cases reported so far, 26 are from Balochistan, 14 from the K-P, 13 from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Islamabad. Polio is a paralyzing disease that has no cure. Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five are essential to provide children high immunity against this disease. The Pakistan Polio Programme conducts multiple mass vaccination drives in a year, bringing the vaccine to children at their doorsteps, while the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) provides vaccinations against 12 childhood diseases free of charge at health facilities every year. Considering the intense polio outbreak, it is crucial for parents to ensure vaccination for all their children under the age of five to keep them protected.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511744/china-pushes-to-ease-pak-afghan-tensions,China pushes to ease Pak-Afghan tensions,"November 25, 2024","IN Top Chinese diplomat visits Kabul days after Islamabad briefing on TTP threat China seems to have launched a fresh diplomatic effort aimed at defusing brewing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan over the terrorist sanctuaries that Kabul has yet to dismantle despite Islamabad's repeated demands. Following a visit to Islamabad, a top Chinese diplomat dealing with Afghanistan travelled to Kabul over the weekend to meet with the Taliban leadership. China's Special Envoy for Afghanistan Yue Xiaoyong held talks with Afghan Deputy Prime Minister for Political Affairs Maulvi Abdul Kabir, Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub and others. His visit to Kabul came days after he was briefed by authorities in Islamabad on the threat posed by the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other militant groups operating from Afghan soil. Sources said Pakistan conveyed to the envoy that without addressing the terror threat, bilateral relations with Kabul would not move forward. It is believed that the visit of the Chinese envoy to Kabul and Islamabad was part of Beijing's latest push to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. China has in the past attempted to mediate between the estranged countries on the TTP issue, though those efforts yielded no progress. Beijing is worried about the fallout of escalating Pakistan-Afghanistan hostilities on its regional ambitions for greater connectivity and trade. Besides, the persistent presence of terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan also threatens Beijing's interests. Chinese nationals have come under terror attacks in Pakistan. This year at least 7 Chinese nationals were killed in two different terrorist attacks. Pakistan's investigations into the March 26 Besham terrorist attack concluded that there was a network connected to TTP was behind the attack. The probe also revealed that the suicide bomber was an Afghan national and the vehicle used in the attack was smuggled into Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan believes Baloch terrorist groups are now closely working with the TTP and also have their training camps in Afghanistan. However, unlike other countries, China usually follows a carefully crafted policy where such concerns are conveyed from behind closed doors. Officials here believe that they have this understanding that the Chinese envoy forcefully raised the issue of terrorist sanctuaries with the Afghan leadership. A statement issued by the Afghan Deputy Prime Minister's Office indicated that Pakistan, and Afghanistan relationship was one of the subjects of discussions. According to the statement, Mr Yue Xiaoyong commended Afghanistan's progress over the past three years and stressed the significance of fostering improved relations and mutual understanding among Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China. The reference to Pakistan, Afghanistan and China, according to observers, shows that Beijing is keen to see issues between Islamabad and Kabul are sorted out. The Afghan deputy prime minister told the Chinese envoy that the Islamic Emirate has consistently guaranteed its neighbours and the international community that Afghanistan poses no threat to any nation and has upheld this assurance over the past three years. ""The Deputy Prime Minister further noted that Afghanistan is transitioning from a prolonged period of conflict and is prioritizing the revitalisation of its national economy and the expansion of regional cooperation,"" according to the readout, which suggests that the Afghan side tried to placate concerns of China and Pakistan.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511743/pm-tasks-speakers-to-address-ppp-concerns,PM tasks speakers to address PPP concerns,"November 25, 2024","PL PM tasks speakers to address PPP concerns Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has instructed the speakers of the National Assembly and Punjab provincial assembly to take steps to address the concerns raised by the PPP, a party that has been propping up the PML-N led coalition government without actually becoming a part of it. The directive came on Sunday during a consultative session held in Lahore attended by NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan. According to officials, the participants reviewed the current political situation while also discussing the PPP's grievances as well as the PTI's protest march which left for Islamabad on Sunday, raising concerns about potential political instability. On November 22, PM Shehbaz established an 11-member committee after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari voiced frustration over the PML-N leadership's approach to coalition governance. The committee, including Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, and Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Khan Cheema, was tasked with facilitating ""political cooperation and conflict resolution"" between the parties. According to a statement issued from the PM's Office, the committee would work with PPP representatives to outline a path forward through dialogue. Earlier, on Saturday, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, who belongs to the PPP, urged the PM to intervene in order to resolve the differences between the two parties, which have a long history of political confrontation. During his meeting with Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar, the governor had also urged the PML-N led Punjab government to honor its commitment with the PPP, stating that the committee formed by the two parties to resolve issues have yielded no results. Khan said a functional coalition between the PML-N and the PPP would be beneficial for the country, warning that if the coalition government fails, it would primarily harm the PML-N, which currently leads the government. Last week, Bilawal had criticized the PML-N led federal government for failing to honor commitments to the PPP. He alleged that the PML-N government had not consulted with the PPP on policy matters such as the recent crackdown against the Virtual Private Networks (VPNs and restrictions imposed on internet access. He had also expressed concern about the proposed amendments to the IRSA Act to pave the way for construction of more canals on the River Indus.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511742/defiant-pti-marchers-knock-on-capital-door,Defiant PTI marchers knock on capital door,"November 25, 2024","PK Clashes reported from Attock bridge  hundreds arrested The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) embarked on a collision course with the government on Sunday as it finally started marching toward the federal capital after refusing to call off the 'final' protest call given by the imprisoned party founder Imran Khan for his release, among other things. The routes leading to the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi have been closed with containers and heavy contingents of the law-enforcement agencies (LEA) personnel were deployed to meet any eventuality. The PTI rallies from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) led by Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, as well as from different cities of Punjab, began advancing towards the D-Chowk ‚Äì located right in front of the Parliament House in the Red Zone of the federal capital. A large PTI procession from K-P entered Punjab from the Attock bridge, Chach Interchange and Ghazi Barotha Canal. The convoy of vehicles stopped at Ghazi for a while, where Chief Minister Gandapur and Bushra Bibi, wife of Imran Khan, addressed the supporters urging them to move forward. When another convoy, coming from Haripur, reached the Attock Bridge, the police resorted to tear gas shelling. The protesters, meanwhile, set fire to the green belts around them, while a Suzuki van parked at Ghazi Bridge was also torched. A policeman was injured when directly hit by a motorcycle rider. The PTI, after entering Punjab, changed its strategy and directed the convoys coming from the Hazara Division, which had reached Taxila under the leadership of Omar Ayub, to join Gandapur-led convoy. Clashes were also reported from the Isakhel Interchange in Dera Ismail Khan. The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily¬óand denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised. He made it clear that no one would be allowed to disrupt the law and order in the capital, and that the administration, police, and LEAs were prepared to deal with any possible situation. He mentioned that Belarus president's visit was crucial in strengthening relationship between the two countries.

The 30-year-old sprinter had hinted earlier this year at the Paris Olympics that she would step away after earning gold, silver, and bronze medals in relay events, contributing to Australia's most successful Summer Games campaign. In a statement confirming her retirement, McKeon expressed mixed emotions, saying, ""I will definitely miss it... It‚Äôs brought me many great relationships and shaped who I am."" However, she added, ""I‚Äôm ready for the next chapter of my life, which I‚Äôm excited for. I haven‚Äôt yet had the chance to fully reflect on everything."" McKeon‚Äôs Olympic journey began in Rio 2016, where she won her first gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay, alongside two relay silvers and a bronze in the 200m freestyle. Her performance at Tokyo 2021 cemented her legacy, with victories in the 100m and 50m freestyle sprints, two relay golds, and three bronze medals ‚Äì the largest medal haul by any athlete at those Games. Australia's swimming coach Rohan Taylor praised McKeon, calling her ""a great role model for younger athletes"" and highlighting her resilience. ""While everyone witnessed her grace, they couldn‚Äôt fully see how tough she is,"" Taylor remarked. Swimming Australia CEO and McKeon‚Äôs uncle, Rob Woodhouse, alongside Taylor, described her victory in the 100m freestyle in Tokyo as a career highlight. In a thrilling race, McKeon edged out Hong Kong‚Äôs Siobhan Haughey by just 0.31 seconds. ""It was one of the greatest races I‚Äôve ever seen,"" Woodhouse commented, also commending McKeon for mentoring younger swimmers. In addition to her six Olympic golds and five world titles, McKeon was part of relay teams that set eight world records, three of which still stand. Reflecting on her journey, McKeon recalled missing out on the London Olympics as a teenager but used that experience to inspire others. ""You have ups and downs, but you keep going and ticking the boxes,"" she said. ""I hope my story shows young athletes that I was once in their position ‚Äì dreaming of achieving something big.""

Baseball, deeply rooted in Taiwanese culture since its introduction during Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945), is among the nation's most beloved sports. The team secured a decisive 4-0 win against Japan in the final at Tokyo Dome on Sunday, sparking widespread celebrations across Taiwan. President Lai Ching-te praised the players in a phone call shared on Instagram, thanking them for bringing pride to Taiwan and showcasing the island‚Äôs achievements beyond its renowned semiconductor industry. Lai also announced that the team would be greeted at the presidential office following their arrival. Defence Minister Wellington Koo, who watched the match at home, described the victory as a historic moment, adding that the fighter jet salute was a fitting gesture to honour the team's achievement. Large crowds gathered in Taiwan to watch the final on outdoor screens, while businesses and restaurants marked the occasion with special discounts. Some companies, including Trend Micro, declared Monday a holiday in celebration. Taiwan participated in the championship under the name ""Chinese Taipei,"" a designation used in most international sporting events to sidestep political tensions with China, which claims the island as its territory. The naming issue has been a contentious topic in Taiwan, with some advocating for the use of ""Taiwan"" in international competitions. A 2018 referendum rejected such a proposal, citing fears that it could provoke China to block the island‚Äôs participation in global events. In Tokyo, Taiwanese fan Wang Ming-chang expressed hope for change, saying, ""Taiwan is our country, and we want to compete under the name of Taiwan in international events.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511746/kurram-rivals-agree-to-cease-fire-for-7-days,Kurram rivals agree to cease fire for 7 days,"November 25, 2024","PK Govt Jirga brokers deal for return of prisoners and bodies An official Jirga on Sunday negotiated a ceasefire between the warring tribesmen in the Kurram district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), as the death toll from the three days of violence rose to 82, according to the officials in the provincial capital and the embattled district. K-P Information Minister Muhammad Ali Saif said in a statement that a government delegation flew in to Parachinar, Kurram's main town, and met with the rival leaders on Saturday and Sunday to try to broker a ceasefire deal and then move to resolve the matter. The government Jirga had returned to Peshawar from Kurram and ""there have been positive developments in engagements with stakeholders,"" Saif said. ""Both sides have agreed to a ceasefire for seven days and return each other's prisoners and bodies,"" he added. Armed groups in Kurram have been engaged in tribal rivalry for decades over a land dispute in the district located near the Afghanistan border. The latest wave of clashes was triggered after gunmen attacked convoys of civilian vehicles on Thursday, killing dozens of passengers. The roadside pogrom sparked retaliatory attacks against local residents and there have been pitched battles between armed groups from both sides. Armed groups attacked settlements that were populated by members of rival groups. According to the latest information obtained from the local police sources, 12 more people were killed in firing incidents in the district overnight, raising the death toll from clashes to 31 in the last 24 hours, and to 75 in the last three days. However, other media reports put the death toll even higher. ""The clashes and convoy attacks on November 21, 22, and 23 have resulted in 82 fatalities and 156 injuries,"" a local administration official told AFP, while speaking on condition of anonymity. Last night, clashes continued in Bagan, Alizai, Balshakhel, Khar Kalay, Maqbal and Kunj Alizai. The fighting intensified when armed groups of the Turi tribe burned and looted the Lower Kurram villages of Kalu Kunj, Badshah Kot and Bagan Bazaar. In the district, many homes had been evacuated, while markets and schools remain closed. A number of petrol stations had also been set alight, the officials said, adding that gunfights with both light and heavy weapons continued into the night. However, no fresh casualties were reported on Sunday morning. ""The mobile network across Kurram remains suspended and traffic on the main highway is halted,"" said another official. ""Our priority today is to broker a ceasefire between both sides. Once that is achieved, we can begin addressing the underlying issues,"" K-P Law Minister Aftab Alam Afridi told AFP.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511745/three-more-polio-cases-confirmed-1,Three more polio cases confirmed,"November 25, 2024","PK Three more polio cases confirmed In a troubling development, three more polio cases have emerged, taking the total number of polio cases reported so far in the country to 55. The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) has confirmed the detection of three wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases. These cases have emerged from DI Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Zhob and Jaffarabad districts of Balochistan. In DI Khan and Zhob, female children are affected while in Jaffarabad the crippling disease has attacked a male child. DI Khan, one of the seven polio endemic districts of southern K-P, has so far reported six polio cases, while this is the third case this year from Zhob and second from Jaffarabad. Pakistan is responding to an intense resurgence of WPV1 this year. Of the 55 cases reported so far, 26 are from Balochistan, 14 from the K-P, 13 from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Islamabad. Polio is a paralyzing disease that has no cure. Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five are essential to provide children high immunity against this disease. The Pakistan Polio Programme conducts multiple mass vaccination drives in a year, bringing the vaccine to children at their doorsteps, while the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) provides vaccinations against 12 childhood diseases free of charge at health facilities every year. Considering the intense polio outbreak, it is crucial for parents to ensure vaccination for all their children under the age of five to keep them protected.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511744/china-pushes-to-ease-pak-afghan-tensions,China pushes to ease Pak-Afghan tensions,"November 25, 2024","PK Top Chinese diplomat visits Kabul days after Islamabad briefing on TTP threat China seems to have launched a fresh diplomatic effort aimed at defusing brewing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan over the terrorist sanctuaries that Kabul has yet to dismantle despite Islamabad's repeated demands. Following a visit to Islamabad, a top Chinese diplomat dealing with Afghanistan travelled to Kabul over the weekend to meet with the Taliban leadership. China's Special Envoy for Afghanistan Yue Xiaoyong held talks with Afghan Deputy Prime Minister for Political Affairs Maulvi Abdul Kabir, Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub and others. His visit to Kabul came days after he was briefed by authorities in Islamabad on the threat posed by the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other militant groups operating from Afghan soil. Sources said Pakistan conveyed to the envoy that without addressing the terror threat, bilateral relations with Kabul would not move forward. It is believed that the visit of the Chinese envoy to Kabul and Islamabad was part of Beijing's latest push to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. China has in the past attempted to mediate between the estranged countries on the TTP issue, though those efforts yielded no progress. Beijing is worried about the fallout of escalating Pakistan-Afghanistan hostilities on its regional ambitions for greater connectivity and trade. Besides, the persistent presence of terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan also threatens Beijing's interests. Chinese nationals have come under terror attacks in Pakistan. This year at least 7 Chinese nationals were killed in two different terrorist attacks. Pakistan's investigations into the March 26 Besham terrorist attack concluded that there was a network connected to TTP was behind the attack. The probe also revealed that the suicide bomber was an Afghan national and the vehicle used in the attack was smuggled into Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan believes Baloch terrorist groups are now closely working with the TTP and also have their training camps in Afghanistan. However, unlike other countries, China usually follows a carefully crafted policy where such concerns are conveyed from behind closed doors. Officials here believe that they have this understanding that the Chinese envoy forcefully raised the issue of terrorist sanctuaries with the Afghan leadership. A statement issued by the Afghan Deputy Prime Minister's Office indicated that Pakistan, and Afghanistan relationship was one of the subjects of discussions. According to the statement, Mr Yue Xiaoyong commended Afghanistan's progress over the past three years and stressed the significance of fostering improved relations and mutual understanding among Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China. The reference to Pakistan, Afghanistan and China, according to observers, shows that Beijing is keen to see issues between Islamabad and Kabul are sorted out. The Afghan deputy prime minister told the Chinese envoy that the Islamic Emirate has consistently guaranteed its neighbours and the international community that Afghanistan poses no threat to any nation and has upheld this assurance over the past three years. ""The Deputy Prime Minister further noted that Afghanistan is transitioning from a prolonged period of conflict and is prioritizing the revitalisation of its national economy and the expansion of regional cooperation,"" according to the readout, which suggests that the Afghan side tried to placate concerns of China and Pakistan.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511743/pm-tasks-speakers-to-address-ppp-concerns,PM tasks speakers to address PPP concerns,"November 25, 2024","US PM tasks speakers to address PPP concerns Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has instructed the speakers of the National Assembly and Punjab provincial assembly to take steps to address the concerns raised by the PPP, a party that has been propping up the PML-N led coalition government without actually becoming a part of it. The directive came on Sunday during a consultative session held in Lahore attended by NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan. According to officials, the participants reviewed the current political situation while also discussing the PPP's grievances as well as the PTI's protest march which left for Islamabad on Sunday, raising concerns about potential political instability. On November 22, PM Shehbaz established an 11-member committee after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari voiced frustration over the PML-N leadership's approach to coalition governance. The committee, including Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, and Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Khan Cheema, was tasked with facilitating ""political cooperation and conflict resolution"" between the parties. According to a statement issued from the PM's Office, the committee would work with PPP representatives to outline a path forward through dialogue. Earlier, on Saturday, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, who belongs to the PPP, urged the PM to intervene in order to resolve the differences between the two parties, which have a long history of political confrontation. During his meeting with Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar, the governor had also urged the PML-N led Punjab government to honor its commitment with the PPP, stating that the committee formed by the two parties to resolve issues have yielded no results. Khan said a functional coalition between the PML-N and the PPP would be beneficial for the country, warning that if the coalition government fails, it would primarily harm the PML-N, which currently leads the government. Last week, Bilawal had criticized the PML-N led federal government for failing to honor commitments to the PPP. He alleged that the PML-N government had not consulted with the PPP on policy matters such as the recent crackdown against the Virtual Private Networks (VPNs and restrictions imposed on internet access. He had also expressed concern about the proposed amendments to the IRSA Act to pave the way for construction of more canals on the River Indus.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511742/defiant-pti-marchers-knock-on-capital-door,Defiant PTI marchers knock on capital door,"November 25, 2024","OM Clashes reported from Attock bridge  hundreds arrested The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) embarked on a collision course with the government on Sunday as it finally started marching toward the federal capital after refusing to call off the 'final' protest call given by the imprisoned party founder Imran Khan for his release, among other things. The routes leading to the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi have been closed with containers and heavy contingents of the law-enforcement agencies (LEA) personnel were deployed to meet any eventuality. The PTI rallies from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) led by Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, as well as from different cities of Punjab, began advancing towards the D-Chowk ‚Äì located right in front of the Parliament House in the Red Zone of the federal capital. A large PTI procession from K-P entered Punjab from the Attock bridge, Chach Interchange and Ghazi Barotha Canal. The convoy of vehicles stopped at Ghazi for a while, where Chief Minister Gandapur and Bushra Bibi, wife of Imran Khan, addressed the supporters urging them to move forward. When another convoy, coming from Haripur, reached the Attock Bridge, the police resorted to tear gas shelling. The protesters, meanwhile, set fire to the green belts around them, while a Suzuki van parked at Ghazi Bridge was also torched. A policeman was injured when directly hit by a motorcycle rider. The PTI, after entering Punjab, changed its strategy and directed the convoys coming from the Hazara Division, which had reached Taxila under the leadership of Omar Ayub, to join Gandapur-led convoy. Clashes were also reported from the Isakhel Interchange in Dera Ismail Khan. The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily¬óand denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised. He made it clear that no one would be allowed to disrupt the law and order in the capital, and that the administration, police, and LEAs were prepared to deal with any possible situation. He mentioned that Belarus president's visit was crucial in strengthening relationship between the two countries.

Held at Auditorium Shores in Town Lake, the contest drew dozens of Powell‚Äôs lookalikes, but the actor couldn‚Äôt attend in person due to filming commitments in England for The Running Man.

Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs appeared upbeat as he entered a New York City courtroom for a bail hearing, hoping to secure his release while facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. The 55-year-old music mogul greeted his family with blown kisses and waves as he entered South Manhattan Federal Court, wearing a beige prison jumpsuit. Unlike previous hearings, he was not shackled and was escorted by US marshals. Family and supporters, including his mother Janice Combs, daughter Chance Combs, son Justin Dior Combs, and adopted son Quincy Brown, attended the hearing on Friday afternoon. The judge deferred the decision on granting him bail, following arguments from prosecutors that Combs could not be ‚Äútrusted‚Äù to follow conditions and might evade legal supervision even with his lawyers‚Äô guidance. Combs is currently detained on a $50 million bond at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, as he awaits his trial. During the hearing, Combs‚Äô legal team pointed to changed circumstances, including new evidence, as reasons to release him, arguing it would allow him to better prepare for his trial scheduled for May 5. Previously, two judges have ruled that he poses a danger to the community and is a flight risk. Assistant US Attorney Christine Slavik stated that Combs‚Äô attempts to contact witnesses from prison, often through family members, demonstrated that he ‚Äúcannot and will not follow rules‚Äù set by his own legal team. ‚ÄúSimply put, the defendant cannot be trusted,‚Äù she said. Slavik further accused Combs‚Äô lawyers of ‚Äúenabling his flouting of rules‚Äù and argued that they had shown an ‚Äúinability to control their client.‚Äù Last week, prosecutors alleged that Combs used jailmates‚Äô phones to intimidate potential witnesses ahead of his trial. According to court documents, he allegedly contacted family members from prison, asking them to reach out to potential victims and craft ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù while making ‚Äúrelentless efforts‚Äù to ‚Äúcorruptly influence witness testimony.‚Äù COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

Known for his bold personality, the streamer visited City Kickboxing, the renowned gym that has produced MMA superstars like Israel Adesanya and Kai Kara-France, but quickly learned the price of challenging an elite fighter. Walking into the gym with his signature confidence, Speed greeted trainers and up-and-coming athletes, declaring, ‚ÄúNobody in here can beat me at boxing.‚Äù After a brief sparring session with an amateur, which left him momentarily shaken, Speed adjusted the rules to better suit his strengths. However, his bravado was tested further when Dan Hooker, a 10-year UFC veteran with 24 wins, entered the cage. Speed, cautious about the UFC star‚Äôs capabilities, insisted, ‚ÄúNo kicking‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs do boxing.‚Äù What followed was a spectacle of endurance and humility. Speed tried to keep his distance, circling the edges of the octagon, but moments of hesitation allowed Hooker to capitalize. The Hangman dropped the streamer multiple times, laughing as he said, ‚ÄúWelcome to my world, brother.‚Äù When Speed protested about a weight difference, Hooker quipped, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lighter than you,‚Äù highlighting the uphill battle Speed faced. Clips of the match, including one where Speed was left clutching his ribs, quickly went viral, with fans praising his courage and laughing at his antics. After the match, Speed admitted, ‚ÄúHe got me good‚Ä¶ I could tell you were going easy on me.‚Äù Hooker returned the compliment on Instagram, calling Speed ‚Äúballs of steel.‚Äù While his UFC dreams may be out of reach, Speed‚Äôs resilience and charisma hint at a promising future in the influencer boxing realm.

During a recent livestream with popular streamer xQc, Drake raised eyebrows with his comments about Steve Lacy, calling him a ""fragile opp"" while acknowledging his music. As Lacy's tracks played in the background, Drake remarked, ‚ÄúThis guy‚Äôs like a fragile opp, but this is a good song though,‚Äù a statement fans quickly linked to Lacy‚Äôs association with Kendrick Lamar. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration with Lamar on tracks like Not Like Us and his presence at Lamar‚Äôs The Pop Out- Ken & Friends concert earlier this year solidified his alliance with the rapper. Their bond is rooted in shared Compton origins, with Lacy openly expressing pride in his hometown and supporting Lamar during his high-profile feud with Drake. A post shared by Shifting Culture (@shiftingculture) Drake‚Äôs comments come amid a backdrop of tension with Kendrick Lamar, who recently released his surprise album GNX. The album, including tracks like Not Like Us and Euphoria, continued to take shots at Drake. Responding to Kendrick‚Äôs diss tracks during the stream, Drake said, ‚ÄúYou need facts to take me out. Fairytales won‚Äôt do it.‚Äù Fans have taken to social media to dissect the remarks, with some viewing them as a playful jab and others interpreting a deeper rivalry. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration on Kendrick‚Äôs PRIDE and his active support for the rapper further fuel speculation about his role in the ongoing feud between the two musical powerhouses. While Drake remains one of the most dominant artists in hip-hop, his remarks during the xQc stream have reignited discussions about alliances and rivalries in the music industry.

When it comes to dog breeds, some stand out for their strength, loyalty, and protective nature. However, a combination of these traits, especially when not managed properly, can lead to aggressive tendencies. While any dog can become aggressive under certain circumstances, there are certain breeds that, due to their history, physical power, or guarding instincts, are more likely to display aggressive behavior if not properly trained and socialized. Understanding these breeds helps ensure responsible pet ownership and safer interactions. Here, we explore 21 of the most dangerous and aggressive dog breeds, highlighting their tendencies and why they may pose a risk if mishandled.  Originally bred as a fighting dog in Japan, the Tosa Inu is large, strong, and protective, making it prone to aggression without proper socialization and training. Due to its potential for aggression, ownership is legally restricted or banned in several countries including the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.  Known for its powerful build and strong prey drive, the Dogo Argentino is territorial and can become aggressive around strangers or unfamiliar animals. This breed has ownership restrictions in several countries, including Australia, Austria, and the UK.  The Fila Brasileiro is fiercely loyal and protective of its territory. It can be highly aggressive towards strangers, requiring firm control and proper training. In countries such as the UK, Australia, and Hong Kong, ownership is either restricted or illegal without special exemption.  While Bull Terriers are often friendly, they can become stubborn and aggressive if not well-trained and socialized. The breed‚Äôs tenacity can lead to dangerous behavior if mishandled.  This large, muscular breed is known for its protective instincts. While they can be affectionate with their families, they can show aggression toward strangers, especially without proper socialization. Rottweilers tend to be more aggressive toward strangers, according to some studies.  Originally bred as farm guardians, Boerboels are protective and powerful, which can lead to aggressive behavior if not trained and managed carefully. Ownership of this breed is restricted in many countries including Denmark, Romania, and Qatar.  Akitas are strong-willed and independent, often showing aggression toward other dogs and strangers without proper training. In some regions, the breed is classified as a dangerous dog due to its territorial instincts.  While this hunting breed is typically strong and confident, it can become aggressive if not socialized properly. Ridgebacks may not be ideal for inexperienced dog owners or families with young children.  Pitbulls have a history as fighting dogs, and their physical strength can make them dangerous if not properly trained and socialized. Many countries, including the UK and Australia, have breed-specific legislation banning Pitbulls or restricting ownership.  Known for their intelligence and loyalty, German Shepherds can become aggressive if they feel their family is under threat. This breed is frequently used for police and military work due to its protective nature.  Boxers are energetic and strong, but they can exhibit aggression if they are not properly exercised or trained. They require consistent management to prevent undesirable behavior.  The Cane Corso is a large and dominant breed, known for its guarding instincts. Without proper training and discipline, they can display territorial aggression.  Siberian Huskies are friendly but have a strong prey drive. Without sufficient exercise and training, they can become aggressive or unpredictable, especially when interacting with other animals.  Dobermans are known for their guarding instincts and protective nature. Without proper training, they can be aggressive towards strangers or perceived threats.  Bulldogs can be stubborn and may show aggression if improperly socialized or provoked. Though generally friendly, they can become territorial or aggressive if mishandled.  Bullmastiffs are protective by nature and can become aggressive toward intruders or unfamiliar animals. Their size and strength make them a formidable breed if not properly trained.  Chow Chows can be aloof and territorial. Without proper training, they can become aggressive toward strangers or other dogs. Their independence can sometimes make them difficult to manage.  Basenjis are independent and can show aggression if not socialized properly. Known for their intelligence and independence, they require firm training and early socialization to prevent aggressive behavior.  A mix of Mastiffs and Pitbulls, Bandogs are powerful and can show aggression if not trained properly. These dogs require experienced handlers to prevent aggressive behavior from escalating.  Though affectionate with family, Staffordshire Bull Terriers can be aggressive toward other dogs if not socialized properly. Despite being loving, they require firm management to prevent potential issues.  Neapolitan Mastiffs are massive and protective. If they sense a threat, they can become aggressive. These dogs need firm training and should be handled with care to prevent unwanted aggression. While many of these breeds are associated with aggression, it‚Äôs essential to remember that most dogs are loving and gentle when properly trained and cared for. Aggression typically arises from mishandling, improper training, or a lack of socialization. Dogs, regardless of their breed, are often more likely to be protective and loyal than dangerous. Responsible ownership, proper training, and early socialization play a crucial role in ensuring that dogs, regardless of their breed, remain well-behaved and safe members of society.

A group of 12 men who were employed by Mohamed Al Fayed have accused the disgraced former Harrods owner of abusive behavior. The men have reported harassment, bullying, and homophobic abuse by Fayed, with some claiming to experience PTSD and ongoing trauma from their time working for him. More than 420 women have also accused Fayed of rape or sexual abuse, with their cases being handled by the Justice for Harrods Survivors group. Discussing the allegations made by male staff, a source told *The Sun*, ""A lot of them have given similar accounts of being bullied, demeaned and being unfairly dismissed or demoted because of Fayed. They often had to leave after speaking up."" Fayed, who passed away in 2023 at the age of 94, was publicly exposed as a sexual abuser in September. Harrods has issued a sincere apology to all the victims. The Metropolitan Police is currently investigating 60 reports of sexual abuse, while Surrey Police is examining one specific alleged incident. Many of Fayed‚Äôs crimes were first uncovered in a 1998 unauthorized biography by journalist Tom Bower. However, additional shocking allegations emerged after a BBC documentary revealed that over 20 former Harrods staff accused Fayed of sexual assault, including rape. Harrods, now under Qatari ownership, expressed being ""utterly appalled"" by the accusations and have ""sincerely"" apologized to the victims.

Rebel Wilson's attempt to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the producers of her directorial debut,The Deb, has been denied by a Los Angeles Superior Court. Judge Thomas Long ruled that the actress‚Äôs claims of sexual harassment and embezzlement, made in an Instagram video and other contexts, do not qualify as protected free speech under California‚Äôs anti-SLAPP statute. The producers, Amanda Ghost, Gregor Cameron, and Vince Holden, allege that Wilson defamed them to gain creative control and force the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Wilson had previously accused the producers of inappropriate behavior toward the film‚Äôs lead actress and embezzling approximately AU $900,000 from the budget. However, lead actress Charlotte MacInnes denied these allegations, stating in court that Wilson‚Äôs claims were baseless and made her feel bullied by the director. While Wilson countersued in October, alleging theft, bullying, and harassment by the producers, her legal team plans to appeal the recent ruling. Camille Vasquez, attorney for the producers, commended the court‚Äôs decision, calling Wilson‚Äôs dismissal motion a ‚Äúcynical attempt‚Äù to suppress valid legal claims.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511805/jon-watts-cancels-wolfs-sequel-after-trust-issues-with-apple-tv,Jon Watts cancels Wolfs sequel after trust issues with Apple TV,"November 25, 2024","HR Jon Watts canceled Wolfs sequel, citing Apple's surprise decision to shift from wide theatrical release to streaming. Jon Watts has revealed he scrapped plans for a sequel to Wolfs, starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, citing a loss of trust in Apple. The director explained that the studio‚Äôs last-minute decision to shift the original film from a wide theatrical release to a limited run followed by streaming led to his decision. Watts shared with Deadline that Apple initially praised his final cut of Wolfs and even commissioned a sequel. However, he was blindsided by the pivot to streaming, learning of the change less than a week before the public announcement. ‚ÄúApple didn‚Äôt cancel the sequel‚ÄîI did‚Äîbecause I no longer trusted them as a creative partner,‚Äù Watts stated. Despite his disappointment, he returned the sequel commission to avoid generating negative press during the film‚Äôs release. Watts also expressed frustration with Apple for ignoring his request to exclude the sequel announcement from their press release. ‚ÄúThey used it to create a positive spin on their streaming decision,‚Äù he said, emphasizing that the move came without explanation or discussion. While proud of Wolfs, Watts felt compelled to take a stand for creative transparency. His experience echoes a growing trend in the industry, exemplified by Doug Liman‚Äôs Road House debacle after Amazon acquired MGM. Liman, who had anticipated a theatrical release, saw the project shifted to streaming, which directly affected compensation for him and his team. ‚ÄúWe need streaming, but agreements must be honored,‚Äù Liman said in an interview. While Watts supports streaming as a medium, his experience highlights tensions between creative expectations and shifting studio priorities. Apple has yet to comment on the matter, but Watts‚Äô principled decision underscores the importance of trust in creative partnerships.

The convoys, originating from the Hazara Interchange, are heading towards D-Chowk in Islamabad.

Despite the police crackdown, Omar Ayub's convoy managed to push back Punjab Police forces at the Hazara Interchange. Ali Amin Gandapur, who is leading the Hazara Division convoy, played a crucial role in helping the convoy break through the police barricades. After overcoming the police blockade, the convoys continued their journey, with vehicles stretching over two kilometers as they moved forward. On the Hazara Motorway, PTI supporters successfully forced police to retreat, with reports of violent clashes and heavy stone-pelting. Several police personnel were injured in the scuffles, and two officers were severely wounded and transferred to hospitals. Among the injured officers were DSPs Chaudhry Zulfiqar and Shahid Gilani, as well as ASI Tabassum. DSP Zulfiqar suffered significant injuries to his back and legs during the confrontation. 'Talks underway' Barrister Gohar Khan and Saif held a 90-minute meeting with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi. Following the meeting, Barrister Gohar described the discussion as significant, confirming that Imran Khan‚Äôs call for a protest remains final and that rumors about it being canceled were untrue. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Barrister Gohar emphasised that the PTI founder‚Äôs stance on the protest was unchanged, and the movement would proceed as planned. The meeting focused on strategic discussions regarding the ongoing political situation and the party's future course of action. When asked about the ongoing negotiations surrounding the protest, Barrister Gohar assured reporters that updates would be provided in due course. He further confirmed that discussions were still ongoing but did not offer further details at this time. 'Final call' The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. Internet services suspension The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily and denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. Several leaders arrested A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised.

Drake has resurfaced in the ongoing rap rivalry with Kendrick Lamar, choosing a Kick stream alongside xQc to fire subtle shots.

Drake‚Äôs timing is noteworthy, coming just a day after Kendrick released his albumGNX, which has been making waves online.

The 30-year-old sprinter had hinted earlier this year at the Paris Olympics that she would step away after earning gold, silver, and bronze medals in relay events, contributing to Australia's most successful Summer Games campaign. In a statement confirming her retirement, McKeon expressed mixed emotions, saying, ""I will definitely miss it... It‚Äôs brought me many great relationships and shaped who I am."" However, she added, ""I‚Äôm ready for the next chapter of my life, which I‚Äôm excited for. I haven‚Äôt yet had the chance to fully reflect on everything."" McKeon‚Äôs Olympic journey began in Rio 2016, where she won her first gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay, alongside two relay silvers and a bronze in the 200m freestyle. Her performance at Tokyo 2021 cemented her legacy, with victories in the 100m and 50m freestyle sprints, two relay golds, and three bronze medals ‚Äì the largest medal haul by any athlete at those Games. Australia's swimming coach Rohan Taylor praised McKeon, calling her ""a great role model for younger athletes"" and highlighting her resilience. ""While everyone witnessed her grace, they couldn‚Äôt fully see how tough she is,"" Taylor remarked. Swimming Australia CEO and McKeon‚Äôs uncle, Rob Woodhouse, alongside Taylor, described her victory in the 100m freestyle in Tokyo as a career highlight. In a thrilling race, McKeon edged out Hong Kong‚Äôs Siobhan Haughey by just 0.31 seconds. ""It was one of the greatest races I‚Äôve ever seen,"" Woodhouse commented, also commending McKeon for mentoring younger swimmers. In addition to her six Olympic golds and five world titles, McKeon was part of relay teams that set eight world records, three of which still stand. Reflecting on her journey, McKeon recalled missing out on the London Olympics as a teenager but used that experience to inspire others. ""You have ups and downs, but you keep going and ticking the boxes,"" she said. ""I hope my story shows young athletes that I was once in their position ‚Äì dreaming of achieving something big.""

Baseball, deeply rooted in Taiwanese culture since its introduction during Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945), is among the nation's most beloved sports. The team secured a decisive 4-0 win against Japan in the final at Tokyo Dome on Sunday, sparking widespread celebrations across Taiwan. President Lai Ching-te praised the players in a phone call shared on Instagram, thanking them for bringing pride to Taiwan and showcasing the island‚Äôs achievements beyond its renowned semiconductor industry. Lai also announced that the team would be greeted at the presidential office following their arrival. Defence Minister Wellington Koo, who watched the match at home, described the victory as a historic moment, adding that the fighter jet salute was a fitting gesture to honour the team's achievement. Large crowds gathered in Taiwan to watch the final on outdoor screens, while businesses and restaurants marked the occasion with special discounts. Some companies, including Trend Micro, declared Monday a holiday in celebration. Taiwan participated in the championship under the name ""Chinese Taipei,"" a designation used in most international sporting events to sidestep political tensions with China, which claims the island as its territory. The naming issue has been a contentious topic in Taiwan, with some advocating for the use of ""Taiwan"" in international competitions. A 2018 referendum rejected such a proposal, citing fears that it could provoke China to block the island‚Äôs participation in global events. In Tokyo, Taiwanese fan Wang Ming-chang expressed hope for change, saying, ""Taiwan is our country, and we want to compete under the name of Taiwan in international events.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511746/kurram-rivals-agree-to-cease-fire-for-7-days,Kurram rivals agree to cease fire for 7 days,"November 25, 2024","DE Govt Jirga brokers deal for return of prisoners and bodies An official Jirga on Sunday negotiated a ceasefire between the warring tribesmen in the Kurram district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), as the death toll from the three days of violence rose to 82, according to the officials in the provincial capital and the embattled district. K-P Information Minister Muhammad Ali Saif said in a statement that a government delegation flew in to Parachinar, Kurram's main town, and met with the rival leaders on Saturday and Sunday to try to broker a ceasefire deal and then move to resolve the matter. The government Jirga had returned to Peshawar from Kurram and ""there have been positive developments in engagements with stakeholders,"" Saif said. ""Both sides have agreed to a ceasefire for seven days and return each other's prisoners and bodies,"" he added. Armed groups in Kurram have been engaged in tribal rivalry for decades over a land dispute in the district located near the Afghanistan border. The latest wave of clashes was triggered after gunmen attacked convoys of civilian vehicles on Thursday, killing dozens of passengers. The roadside pogrom sparked retaliatory attacks against local residents and there have been pitched battles between armed groups from both sides. Armed groups attacked settlements that were populated by members of rival groups. According to the latest information obtained from the local police sources, 12 more people were killed in firing incidents in the district overnight, raising the death toll from clashes to 31 in the last 24 hours, and to 75 in the last three days. However, other media reports put the death toll even higher. ""The clashes and convoy attacks on November 21, 22, and 23 have resulted in 82 fatalities and 156 injuries,"" a local administration official told AFP, while speaking on condition of anonymity. Last night, clashes continued in Bagan, Alizai, Balshakhel, Khar Kalay, Maqbal and Kunj Alizai. The fighting intensified when armed groups of the Turi tribe burned and looted the Lower Kurram villages of Kalu Kunj, Badshah Kot and Bagan Bazaar. In the district, many homes had been evacuated, while markets and schools remain closed. A number of petrol stations had also been set alight, the officials said, adding that gunfights with both light and heavy weapons continued into the night. However, no fresh casualties were reported on Sunday morning. ""The mobile network across Kurram remains suspended and traffic on the main highway is halted,"" said another official. ""Our priority today is to broker a ceasefire between both sides. Once that is achieved, we can begin addressing the underlying issues,"" K-P Law Minister Aftab Alam Afridi told AFP.

DI Khan, one of the seven polio endemic districts of southern K-P, has so far reported six polio cases, while this is the third case this year from Zhob and second from Jaffarabad. Pakistan is responding to an intense resurgence of WPV1 this year. Of the 55 cases reported so far, 26 are from Balochistan, 14 from the K-P, 13 from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Islamabad. Polio is a paralyzing disease that has no cure. Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five are essential to provide children high immunity against this disease. The Pakistan Polio Programme conducts multiple mass vaccination drives in a year, bringing the vaccine to children at their doorsteps, while the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) provides vaccinations against 12 childhood diseases free of charge at health facilities every year. Considering the intense polio outbreak, it is crucial for parents to ensure vaccination for all their children under the age of five to keep them protected.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511744/china-pushes-to-ease-pak-afghan-tensions,China pushes to ease Pak-Afghan tensions,"November 25, 2024","IN Top Chinese diplomat visits Kabul days after Islamabad briefing on TTP threat China seems to have launched a fresh diplomatic effort aimed at defusing brewing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan over the terrorist sanctuaries that Kabul has yet to dismantle despite Islamabad's repeated demands. Following a visit to Islamabad, a top Chinese diplomat dealing with Afghanistan travelled to Kabul over the weekend to meet with the Taliban leadership. China's Special Envoy for Afghanistan Yue Xiaoyong held talks with Afghan Deputy Prime Minister for Political Affairs Maulvi Abdul Kabir, Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub and others. His visit to Kabul came days after he was briefed by authorities in Islamabad on the threat posed by the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other militant groups operating from Afghan soil. Sources said Pakistan conveyed to the envoy that without addressing the terror threat, bilateral relations with Kabul would not move forward. It is believed that the visit of the Chinese envoy to Kabul and Islamabad was part of Beijing's latest push to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. China has in the past attempted to mediate between the estranged countries on the TTP issue, though those efforts yielded no progress. Beijing is worried about the fallout of escalating Pakistan-Afghanistan hostilities on its regional ambitions for greater connectivity and trade. Besides, the persistent presence of terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan also threatens Beijing's interests. Chinese nationals have come under terror attacks in Pakistan. This year at least 7 Chinese nationals were killed in two different terrorist attacks. Pakistan's investigations into the March 26 Besham terrorist attack concluded that there was a network connected to TTP was behind the attack. The probe also revealed that the suicide bomber was an Afghan national and the vehicle used in the attack was smuggled into Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan believes Baloch terrorist groups are now closely working with the TTP and also have their training camps in Afghanistan. However, unlike other countries, China usually follows a carefully crafted policy where such concerns are conveyed from behind closed doors. Officials here believe that they have this understanding that the Chinese envoy forcefully raised the issue of terrorist sanctuaries with the Afghan leadership. A statement issued by the Afghan Deputy Prime Minister's Office indicated that Pakistan, and Afghanistan relationship was one of the subjects of discussions. According to the statement, Mr Yue Xiaoyong commended Afghanistan's progress over the past three years and stressed the significance of fostering improved relations and mutual understanding among Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China. The reference to Pakistan, Afghanistan and China, according to observers, shows that Beijing is keen to see issues between Islamabad and Kabul are sorted out. The Afghan deputy prime minister told the Chinese envoy that the Islamic Emirate has consistently guaranteed its neighbours and the international community that Afghanistan poses no threat to any nation and has upheld this assurance over the past three years. ""The Deputy Prime Minister further noted that Afghanistan is transitioning from a prolonged period of conflict and is prioritizing the revitalisation of its national economy and the expansion of regional cooperation,"" according to the readout, which suggests that the Afghan side tried to placate concerns of China and Pakistan.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511743/pm-tasks-speakers-to-address-ppp-concerns,PM tasks speakers to address PPP concerns,"November 25, 2024","US PM tasks speakers to address PPP concerns Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has instructed the speakers of the National Assembly and Punjab provincial assembly to take steps to address the concerns raised by the PPP, a party that has been propping up the PML-N led coalition government without actually becoming a part of it. The directive came on Sunday during a consultative session held in Lahore attended by NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan. According to officials, the participants reviewed the current political situation while also discussing the PPP's grievances as well as the PTI's protest march which left for Islamabad on Sunday, raising concerns about potential political instability. On November 22, PM Shehbaz established an 11-member committee after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari voiced frustration over the PML-N leadership's approach to coalition governance. The committee, including Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, and Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Khan Cheema, was tasked with facilitating ""political cooperation and conflict resolution"" between the parties. According to a statement issued from the PM's Office, the committee would work with PPP representatives to outline a path forward through dialogue. Earlier, on Saturday, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, who belongs to the PPP, urged the PM to intervene in order to resolve the differences between the two parties, which have a long history of political confrontation. During his meeting with Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar, the governor had also urged the PML-N led Punjab government to honor its commitment with the PPP, stating that the committee formed by the two parties to resolve issues have yielded no results. Khan said a functional coalition between the PML-N and the PPP would be beneficial for the country, warning that if the coalition government fails, it would primarily harm the PML-N, which currently leads the government. Last week, Bilawal had criticized the PML-N led federal government for failing to honor commitments to the PPP. He alleged that the PML-N government had not consulted with the PPP on policy matters such as the recent crackdown against the Virtual Private Networks (VPNs and restrictions imposed on internet access. He had also expressed concern about the proposed amendments to the IRSA Act to pave the way for construction of more canals on the River Indus.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511742/defiant-pti-marchers-knock-on-capital-door,Defiant PTI marchers knock on capital door,"November 25, 2024","US Clashes reported from Attock bridge  hundreds arrested The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) embarked on a collision course with the government on Sunday as it finally started marching toward the federal capital after refusing to call off the 'final' protest call given by the imprisoned party founder Imran Khan for his release, among other things. The routes leading to the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi have been closed with containers and heavy contingents of the law-enforcement agencies (LEA) personnel were deployed to meet any eventuality. The PTI rallies from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) led by Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, as well as from different cities of Punjab, began advancing towards the D-Chowk ‚Äì located right in front of the Parliament House in the Red Zone of the federal capital. A large PTI procession from K-P entered Punjab from the Attock bridge, Chach Interchange and Ghazi Barotha Canal. The convoy of vehicles stopped at Ghazi for a while, where Chief Minister Gandapur and Bushra Bibi, wife of Imran Khan, addressed the supporters urging them to move forward. When another convoy, coming from Haripur, reached the Attock Bridge, the police resorted to tear gas shelling. The protesters, meanwhile, set fire to the green belts around them, while a Suzuki van parked at Ghazi Bridge was also torched. A policeman was injured when directly hit by a motorcycle rider. The PTI, after entering Punjab, changed its strategy and directed the convoys coming from the Hazara Division, which had reached Taxila under the leadership of Omar Ayub, to join Gandapur-led convoy. Clashes were also reported from the Isakhel Interchange in Dera Ismail Khan. The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily¬óand denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised. He made it clear that no one would be allowed to disrupt the law and order in the capital, and that the administration, police, and LEAs were prepared to deal with any possible situation. He mentioned that Belarus president's visit was crucial in strengthening relationship between the two countries.

Held at Auditorium Shores in Town Lake, the contest drew dozens of Powell‚Äôs lookalikes, but the actor couldn‚Äôt attend in person due to filming commitments in England for The Running Man.

Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs appeared upbeat as he entered a New York City courtroom for a bail hearing, hoping to secure his release while facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. The 55-year-old music mogul greeted his family with blown kisses and waves as he entered South Manhattan Federal Court, wearing a beige prison jumpsuit. Unlike previous hearings, he was not shackled and was escorted by US marshals. Family and supporters, including his mother Janice Combs, daughter Chance Combs, son Justin Dior Combs, and adopted son Quincy Brown, attended the hearing on Friday afternoon. The judge deferred the decision on granting him bail, following arguments from prosecutors that Combs could not be ‚Äútrusted‚Äù to follow conditions and might evade legal supervision even with his lawyers‚Äô guidance. Combs is currently detained on a $50 million bond at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, as he awaits his trial. During the hearing, Combs‚Äô legal team pointed to changed circumstances, including new evidence, as reasons to release him, arguing it would allow him to better prepare for his trial scheduled for May 5. Previously, two judges have ruled that he poses a danger to the community and is a flight risk. Assistant US Attorney Christine Slavik stated that Combs‚Äô attempts to contact witnesses from prison, often through family members, demonstrated that he ‚Äúcannot and will not follow rules‚Äù set by his own legal team. ‚ÄúSimply put, the defendant cannot be trusted,‚Äù she said. Slavik further accused Combs‚Äô lawyers of ‚Äúenabling his flouting of rules‚Äù and argued that they had shown an ‚Äúinability to control their client.‚Äù Last week, prosecutors alleged that Combs used jailmates‚Äô phones to intimidate potential witnesses ahead of his trial. According to court documents, he allegedly contacted family members from prison, asking them to reach out to potential victims and craft ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù while making ‚Äúrelentless efforts‚Äù to ‚Äúcorruptly influence witness testimony.‚Äù COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

IShowSpeed‚Äôs adventurous 2024 streaming tour took a bruising turn in New Zealand when he stepped into the cage with UFC veteran Dan Hooker. Known for his bold personality, the streamer visited City Kickboxing, the renowned gym that has produced MMA superstars like Israel Adesanya and Kai Kara-France, but quickly learned the price of challenging an elite fighter. Walking into the gym with his signature confidence, Speed greeted trainers and up-and-coming athletes, declaring, ‚ÄúNobody in here can beat me at boxing.‚Äù After a brief sparring session with an amateur, which left him momentarily shaken, Speed adjusted the rules to better suit his strengths. However, his bravado was tested further when Dan Hooker, a 10-year UFC veteran with 24 wins, entered the cage. Speed, cautious about the UFC star‚Äôs capabilities, insisted, ‚ÄúNo kicking‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs do boxing.‚Äù What followed was a spectacle of endurance and humility. Speed tried to keep his distance, circling the edges of the octagon, but moments of hesitation allowed Hooker to capitalize. The Hangman dropped the streamer multiple times, laughing as he said, ‚ÄúWelcome to my world, brother.‚Äù When Speed protested about a weight difference, Hooker quipped, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lighter than you,‚Äù highlighting the uphill battle Speed faced. Clips of the match, including one where Speed was left clutching his ribs, quickly went viral, with fans praising his courage and laughing at his antics. After the match, Speed admitted, ‚ÄúHe got me good‚Ä¶ I could tell you were going easy on me.‚Äù Hooker returned the compliment on Instagram, calling Speed ‚Äúballs of steel.‚Äù While his UFC dreams may be out of reach, Speed‚Äôs resilience and charisma hint at a promising future in the influencer boxing realm.

During a recent livestream with popular streamer xQc, Drake raised eyebrows with his comments about Steve Lacy, calling him a ""fragile opp"" while acknowledging his music. As Lacy's tracks played in the background, Drake remarked, ‚ÄúThis guy‚Äôs like a fragile opp, but this is a good song though,‚Äù a statement fans quickly linked to Lacy‚Äôs association with Kendrick Lamar. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration with Lamar on tracks like Not Like Us and his presence at Lamar‚Äôs The Pop Out- Ken & Friends concert earlier this year solidified his alliance with the rapper. Their bond is rooted in shared Compton origins, with Lacy openly expressing pride in his hometown and supporting Lamar during his high-profile feud with Drake. A post shared by Shifting Culture (@shiftingculture) Drake‚Äôs comments come amid a backdrop of tension with Kendrick Lamar, who recently released his surprise album GNX. The album, including tracks like Not Like Us and Euphoria, continued to take shots at Drake. Responding to Kendrick‚Äôs diss tracks during the stream, Drake said, ‚ÄúYou need facts to take me out. Fairytales won‚Äôt do it.‚Äù Fans have taken to social media to dissect the remarks, with some viewing them as a playful jab and others interpreting a deeper rivalry. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration on Kendrick‚Äôs PRIDE and his active support for the rapper further fuel speculation about his role in the ongoing feud between the two musical powerhouses. While Drake remains one of the most dominant artists in hip-hop, his remarks during the xQc stream have reignited discussions about alliances and rivalries in the music industry.

When it comes to dog breeds, some stand out for their strength, loyalty, and protective nature. However, a combination of these traits, especially when not managed properly, can lead to aggressive tendencies. While any dog can become aggressive under certain circumstances, there are certain breeds that, due to their history, physical power, or guarding instincts, are more likely to display aggressive behavior if not properly trained and socialized. Understanding these breeds helps ensure responsible pet ownership and safer interactions. Here, we explore 21 of the most dangerous and aggressive dog breeds, highlighting their tendencies and why they may pose a risk if mishandled.  Originally bred as a fighting dog in Japan, the Tosa Inu is large, strong, and protective, making it prone to aggression without proper socialization and training. Due to its potential for aggression, ownership is legally restricted or banned in several countries including the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.  Known for its powerful build and strong prey drive, the Dogo Argentino is territorial and can become aggressive around strangers or unfamiliar animals. This breed has ownership restrictions in several countries, including Australia, Austria, and the UK.  The Fila Brasileiro is fiercely loyal and protective of its territory. It can be highly aggressive towards strangers, requiring firm control and proper training. In countries such as the UK, Australia, and Hong Kong, ownership is either restricted or illegal without special exemption.  While Bull Terriers are often friendly, they can become stubborn and aggressive if not well-trained and socialized. The breed‚Äôs tenacity can lead to dangerous behavior if mishandled.  This large, muscular breed is known for its protective instincts. While they can be affectionate with their families, they can show aggression toward strangers, especially without proper socialization. Rottweilers tend to be more aggressive toward strangers, according to some studies.  Originally bred as farm guardians, Boerboels are protective and powerful, which can lead to aggressive behavior if not trained and managed carefully. Ownership of this breed is restricted in many countries including Denmark, Romania, and Qatar.  Akitas are strong-willed and independent, often showing aggression toward other dogs and strangers without proper training. In some regions, the breed is classified as a dangerous dog due to its territorial instincts.  While this hunting breed is typically strong and confident, it can become aggressive if not socialized properly. Ridgebacks may not be ideal for inexperienced dog owners or families with young children.  Pitbulls have a history as fighting dogs, and their physical strength can make them dangerous if not properly trained and socialized. Many countries, including the UK and Australia, have breed-specific legislation banning Pitbulls or restricting ownership.  Known for their intelligence and loyalty, German Shepherds can become aggressive if they feel their family is under threat. This breed is frequently used for police and military work due to its protective nature.  Boxers are energetic and strong, but they can exhibit aggression if they are not properly exercised or trained. They require consistent management to prevent undesirable behavior.  The Cane Corso is a large and dominant breed, known for its guarding instincts. Without proper training and discipline, they can display territorial aggression.  Siberian Huskies are friendly but have a strong prey drive. Without sufficient exercise and training, they can become aggressive or unpredictable, especially when interacting with other animals.  Dobermans are known for their guarding instincts and protective nature. Without proper training, they can be aggressive towards strangers or perceived threats.  Bulldogs can be stubborn and may show aggression if improperly socialized or provoked. Though generally friendly, they can become territorial or aggressive if mishandled.  Bullmastiffs are protective by nature and can become aggressive toward intruders or unfamiliar animals. Their size and strength make them a formidable breed if not properly trained.  Chow Chows can be aloof and territorial. Without proper training, they can become aggressive toward strangers or other dogs. Their independence can sometimes make them difficult to manage.  Basenjis are independent and can show aggression if not socialized properly. Known for their intelligence and independence, they require firm training and early socialization to prevent aggressive behavior.  A mix of Mastiffs and Pitbulls, Bandogs are powerful and can show aggression if not trained properly. These dogs require experienced handlers to prevent aggressive behavior from escalating.  Though affectionate with family, Staffordshire Bull Terriers can be aggressive toward other dogs if not socialized properly. Despite being loving, they require firm management to prevent potential issues.  Neapolitan Mastiffs are massive and protective. If they sense a threat, they can become aggressive. These dogs need firm training and should be handled with care to prevent unwanted aggression. While many of these breeds are associated with aggression, it‚Äôs essential to remember that most dogs are loving and gentle when properly trained and cared for. Aggression typically arises from mishandling, improper training, or a lack of socialization. Dogs, regardless of their breed, are often more likely to be protective and loyal than dangerous. Responsible ownership, proper training, and early socialization play a crucial role in ensuring that dogs, regardless of their breed, remain well-behaved and safe members of society.

A group of 12 men who were employed by Mohamed Al Fayed have accused the disgraced former Harrods owner of abusive behavior. The men have reported harassment, bullying, and homophobic abuse by Fayed, with some claiming to experience PTSD and ongoing trauma from their time working for him. More than 420 women have also accused Fayed of rape or sexual abuse, with their cases being handled by the Justice for Harrods Survivors group. Discussing the allegations made by male staff, a source told *The Sun*, ""A lot of them have given similar accounts of being bullied, demeaned and being unfairly dismissed or demoted because of Fayed. They often had to leave after speaking up."" Fayed, who passed away in 2023 at the age of 94, was publicly exposed as a sexual abuser in September. Harrods has issued a sincere apology to all the victims. The Metropolitan Police is currently investigating 60 reports of sexual abuse, while Surrey Police is examining one specific alleged incident. Many of Fayed‚Äôs crimes were first uncovered in a 1998 unauthorized biography by journalist Tom Bower. However, additional shocking allegations emerged after a BBC documentary revealed that over 20 former Harrods staff accused Fayed of sexual assault, including rape. Harrods, now under Qatari ownership, expressed being ""utterly appalled"" by the accusations and have ""sincerely"" apologized to the victims.

Rebel Wilson's attempt to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the producers of her directorial debut,The Deb, has been denied by a Los Angeles Superior Court. Judge Thomas Long ruled that the actress‚Äôs claims of sexual harassment and embezzlement, made in an Instagram video and other contexts, do not qualify as protected free speech under California‚Äôs anti-SLAPP statute. The producers, Amanda Ghost, Gregor Cameron, and Vince Holden, allege that Wilson defamed them to gain creative control and force the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Wilson had previously accused the producers of inappropriate behavior toward the film‚Äôs lead actress and embezzling approximately AU $900,000 from the budget. However, lead actress Charlotte MacInnes denied these allegations, stating in court that Wilson‚Äôs claims were baseless and made her feel bullied by the director. While Wilson countersued in October, alleging theft, bullying, and harassment by the producers, her legal team plans to appeal the recent ruling. Camille Vasquez, attorney for the producers, commended the court‚Äôs decision, calling Wilson‚Äôs dismissal motion a ‚Äúcynical attempt‚Äù to suppress valid legal claims.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511805/jon-watts-cancels-wolfs-sequel-after-trust-issues-with-apple-tv,Jon Watts cancels Wolfs sequel after trust issues with Apple TV,"November 25, 2024","TR Jon Watts canceled Wolfs sequel, citing Apple's surprise decision to shift from wide theatrical release to streaming. Jon Watts has revealed he scrapped plans for a sequel to Wolfs, starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, citing a loss of trust in Apple. The director explained that the studio‚Äôs last-minute decision to shift the original film from a wide theatrical release to a limited run followed by streaming led to his decision. Watts shared with Deadline that Apple initially praised his final cut of Wolfs and even commissioned a sequel. However, he was blindsided by the pivot to streaming, learning of the change less than a week before the public announcement. ‚ÄúApple didn‚Äôt cancel the sequel‚ÄîI did‚Äîbecause I no longer trusted them as a creative partner,‚Äù Watts stated. Despite his disappointment, he returned the sequel commission to avoid generating negative press during the film‚Äôs release. Watts also expressed frustration with Apple for ignoring his request to exclude the sequel announcement from their press release. ‚ÄúThey used it to create a positive spin on their streaming decision,‚Äù he said, emphasizing that the move came without explanation or discussion. While proud of Wolfs, Watts felt compelled to take a stand for creative transparency. His experience echoes a growing trend in the industry, exemplified by Doug Liman‚Äôs Road House debacle after Amazon acquired MGM. Liman, who had anticipated a theatrical release, saw the project shifted to streaming, which directly affected compensation for him and his team. ‚ÄúWe need streaming, but agreements must be honored,‚Äù Liman said in an interview. While Watts supports streaming as a medium, his experience highlights tensions between creative expectations and shifting studio priorities. Apple has yet to comment on the matter, but Watts‚Äô principled decision underscores the importance of trust in creative partnerships.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511799/pti-convoys-face-tear-gas-as-march-towards-islamabad-continues,PTI convoys face tear gas as march towards Islamabad continues,"November 25, 2024","RU PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar says talks are underway. PTI convoys led by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Opposition leader, Omar Ayub, entered Punjab premises on the call of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan. The convoys, originating from the Hazara Interchange, are heading towards D-Chowk in Islamabad. As the convoys advanced, they encountered heavy resistance from the police at the Ghazi Brotha Bridge, where intense shelling was reported. Despite the police crackdown, Omar Ayub's convoy managed to push back Punjab Police forces at the Hazara Interchange. Ali Amin Gandapur, who is leading the Hazara Division convoy, played a crucial role in helping the convoy break through the police barricades. After overcoming the police blockade, the convoys continued their journey, with vehicles stretching over two kilometers as they moved forward. On the Hazara Motorway, PTI supporters successfully forced police to retreat, with reports of violent clashes and heavy stone-pelting. Several police personnel were injured in the scuffles, and two officers were severely wounded and transferred to hospitals. Among the injured officers were DSPs Chaudhry Zulfiqar and Shahid Gilani, as well as ASI Tabassum. DSP Zulfiqar suffered significant injuries to his back and legs during the confrontation. 'Talks underway' Barrister Gohar Khan and Saif held a 90-minute meeting with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi. Following the meeting, Barrister Gohar described the discussion as significant, confirming that Imran Khan‚Äôs call for a protest remains final and that rumors about it being canceled were untrue. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Barrister Gohar emphasised that the PTI founder‚Äôs stance on the protest was unchanged, and the movement would proceed as planned. The meeting focused on strategic discussions regarding the ongoing political situation and the party's future course of action. When asked about the ongoing negotiations surrounding the protest, Barrister Gohar assured reporters that updates would be provided in due course. He further confirmed that discussions were still ongoing but did not offer further details at this time. 'Final call' The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. Internet services suspension The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily and denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. Several leaders arrested A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised.

Rebel Wilson's attempt to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the producers of her directorial debut,The Deb, has been denied by a Los Angeles Superior Court. Judge Thomas Long ruled that the actress‚Äôs claims of sexual harassment and embezzlement, made in an Instagram video and other contexts, do not qualify as protected free speech under California‚Äôs anti-SLAPP statute. The producers, Amanda Ghost, Gregor Cameron, and Vince Holden, allege that Wilson defamed them to gain creative control and force the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Wilson had previously accused the producers of inappropriate behavior toward the film‚Äôs lead actress and embezzling approximately AU $900,000 from the budget. However, lead actress Charlotte MacInnes denied these allegations, stating in court that Wilson‚Äôs claims were baseless and made her feel bullied by the director. While Wilson countersued in October, alleging theft, bullying, and harassment by the producers, her legal team plans to appeal the recent ruling. Camille Vasquez, attorney for the producers, commended the court‚Äôs decision, calling Wilson‚Äôs dismissal motion a ‚Äúcynical attempt‚Äù to suppress valid legal claims.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511805/jon-watts-cancels-wolfs-sequel-after-trust-issues-with-apple-tv,Jon Watts cancels Wolfs sequel after trust issues with Apple TV,"November 25, 2024","TR Jon Watts canceled Wolfs sequel, citing Apple's surprise decision to shift from wide theatrical release to streaming. Jon Watts has revealed he scrapped plans for a sequel to Wolfs, starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, citing a loss of trust in Apple. The director explained that the studio‚Äôs last-minute decision to shift the original film from a wide theatrical release to a limited run followed by streaming led to his decision. Watts shared with Deadline that Apple initially praised his final cut of Wolfs and even commissioned a sequel. However, he was blindsided by the pivot to streaming, learning of the change less than a week before the public announcement. ‚ÄúApple didn‚Äôt cancel the sequel‚ÄîI did‚Äîbecause I no longer trusted them as a creative partner,‚Äù Watts stated. Despite his disappointment, he returned the sequel commission to avoid generating negative press during the film‚Äôs release. Watts also expressed frustration with Apple for ignoring his request to exclude the sequel announcement from their press release. ‚ÄúThey used it to create a positive spin on their streaming decision,‚Äù he said, emphasizing that the move came without explanation or discussion. While proud of Wolfs, Watts felt compelled to take a stand for creative transparency. His experience echoes a growing trend in the industry, exemplified by Doug Liman‚Äôs Road House debacle after Amazon acquired MGM. Liman, who had anticipated a theatrical release, saw the project shifted to streaming, which directly affected compensation for him and his team. ‚ÄúWe need streaming, but agreements must be honored,‚Äù Liman said in an interview. While Watts supports streaming as a medium, his experience highlights tensions between creative expectations and shifting studio priorities. Apple has yet to comment on the matter, but Watts‚Äô principled decision underscores the importance of trust in creative partnerships.

Held at Auditorium Shores in Town Lake, the contest drew dozens of Powell‚Äôs lookalikes, but the actor couldn‚Äôt attend in person due to filming commitments in England for The Running Man.

Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs appeared upbeat as he entered a New York City courtroom for a bail hearing, hoping to secure his release while facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. The 55-year-old music mogul greeted his family with blown kisses and waves as he entered South Manhattan Federal Court, wearing a beige prison jumpsuit. Unlike previous hearings, he was not shackled and was escorted by US marshals. Family and supporters, including his mother Janice Combs, daughter Chance Combs, son Justin Dior Combs, and adopted son Quincy Brown, attended the hearing on Friday afternoon. The judge deferred the decision on granting him bail, following arguments from prosecutors that Combs could not be ‚Äútrusted‚Äù to follow conditions and might evade legal supervision even with his lawyers‚Äô guidance. Combs is currently detained on a $50 million bond at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, as he awaits his trial. During the hearing, Combs‚Äô legal team pointed to changed circumstances, including new evidence, as reasons to release him, arguing it would allow him to better prepare for his trial scheduled for May 5. Previously, two judges have ruled that he poses a danger to the community and is a flight risk. Assistant US Attorney Christine Slavik stated that Combs‚Äô attempts to contact witnesses from prison, often through family members, demonstrated that he ‚Äúcannot and will not follow rules‚Äù set by his own legal team. ‚ÄúSimply put, the defendant cannot be trusted,‚Äù she said. Slavik further accused Combs‚Äô lawyers of ‚Äúenabling his flouting of rules‚Äù and argued that they had shown an ‚Äúinability to control their client.‚Äù Last week, prosecutors alleged that Combs used jailmates‚Äô phones to intimidate potential witnesses ahead of his trial. According to court documents, he allegedly contacted family members from prison, asking them to reach out to potential victims and craft ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù while making ‚Äúrelentless efforts‚Äù to ‚Äúcorruptly influence witness testimony.‚Äù COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

Dr. Betteridge, founder of JB Aesthetics in London, shared his analysis in an Instagram video, listing potential enhancements including a facelift, upper eyelid surgery, a nose job, and a surgical brow lift. ‚ÄúShe most likely had some degree of surgical facelift done via an endoscopic approach, meaning it was minimally invasive,‚Äù he explained. Additional treatments allegedly include botox, lip fillers, a lip lift, and veneers, paired with laser resurfacing and a dermatologist-led skincare routine. Fans were quick to praise her transformation on social media. ‚ÄúShe looks amazing. I wish I had $200-$300K,‚Äù one user commented, while another said, ‚ÄúIncredible work! She looks fantastic.‚Äù A post shared by Dr Jonny Betteridge (@drjb.aesthetics) Lohan has attributed her refreshed glow to skincare.

IShowSpeed‚Äôs adventurous 2024 streaming tour took a bruising turn in New Zealand when he stepped into the cage with UFC veteran Dan Hooker. Known for his bold personality, the streamer visited City Kickboxing, the renowned gym that has produced MMA superstars like Israel Adesanya and Kai Kara-France, but quickly learned the price of challenging an elite fighter. Walking into the gym with his signature confidence, Speed greeted trainers and up-and-coming athletes, declaring, ‚ÄúNobody in here can beat me at boxing.‚Äù After a brief sparring session with an amateur, which left him momentarily shaken, Speed adjusted the rules to better suit his strengths. However, his bravado was tested further when Dan Hooker, a 10-year UFC veteran with 24 wins, entered the cage. Speed, cautious about the UFC star‚Äôs capabilities, insisted, ‚ÄúNo kicking‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs do boxing.‚Äù What followed was a spectacle of endurance and humility. Speed tried to keep his distance, circling the edges of the octagon, but moments of hesitation allowed Hooker to capitalize. The Hangman dropped the streamer multiple times, laughing as he said, ‚ÄúWelcome to my world, brother.‚Äù When Speed protested about a weight difference, Hooker quipped, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lighter than you,‚Äù highlighting the uphill battle Speed faced. Clips of the match, including one where Speed was left clutching his ribs, quickly went viral, with fans praising his courage and laughing at his antics. After the match, Speed admitted, ‚ÄúHe got me good‚Ä¶ I could tell you were going easy on me.‚Äù Hooker returned the compliment on Instagram, calling Speed ‚Äúballs of steel.‚Äù While his UFC dreams may be out of reach, Speed‚Äôs resilience and charisma hint at a promising future in the influencer boxing realm.

During a recent livestream with popular streamer xQc, Drake raised eyebrows with his comments about Steve Lacy, calling him a ""fragile opp"" while acknowledging his music. As Lacy's tracks played in the background, Drake remarked, ‚ÄúThis guy‚Äôs like a fragile opp, but this is a good song though,‚Äù a statement fans quickly linked to Lacy‚Äôs association with Kendrick Lamar. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration with Lamar on tracks like Not Like Us and his presence at Lamar‚Äôs The Pop Out- Ken & Friends concert earlier this year solidified his alliance with the rapper. Their bond is rooted in shared Compton origins, with Lacy openly expressing pride in his hometown and supporting Lamar during his high-profile feud with Drake. A post shared by Shifting Culture (@shiftingculture) Drake‚Äôs comments come amid a backdrop of tension with Kendrick Lamar, who recently released his surprise album GNX. The album, including tracks like Not Like Us and Euphoria, continued to take shots at Drake. Responding to Kendrick‚Äôs diss tracks during the stream, Drake said, ‚ÄúYou need facts to take me out. Fairytales won‚Äôt do it.‚Äù Fans have taken to social media to dissect the remarks, with some viewing them as a playful jab and others interpreting a deeper rivalry. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration on Kendrick‚Äôs PRIDE and his active support for the rapper further fuel speculation about his role in the ongoing feud between the two musical powerhouses. While Drake remains one of the most dominant artists in hip-hop, his remarks during the xQc stream have reignited discussions about alliances and rivalries in the music industry.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511795/21-dangerous-and-aggressive-dog-breeds-you-should-know-about,21 Dangerous and Aggressive Dog Breeds You Should Know About,Date not found,"Some dog breeds are known for their power and potential danger if mishandled‚Äîhere are 21 to be aware of. When it comes to dog breeds, some stand out for their strength, loyalty, and protective nature. However, a combination of these traits, especially when not managed properly, can lead to aggressive tendencies. While any dog can become aggressive under certain circumstances, there are certain breeds that, due to their history, physical power, or guarding instincts, are more likely to display aggressive behavior if not properly trained and socialized. Understanding these breeds helps ensure responsible pet ownership and safer interactions. Here, we explore 21 of the most dangerous and aggressive dog breeds, highlighting their tendencies and why they may pose a risk if mishandled.  Originally bred as a fighting dog in Japan, the Tosa Inu is large, strong, and protective, making it prone to aggression without proper socialization and training. Due to its potential for aggression, ownership is legally restricted or banned in several countries including the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.  Known for its powerful build and strong prey drive, the Dogo Argentino is territorial and can become aggressive around strangers or unfamiliar animals. This breed has ownership restrictions in several countries, including Australia, Austria, and the UK.  The Fila Brasileiro is fiercely loyal and protective of its territory. It can be highly aggressive towards strangers, requiring firm control and proper training. In countries such as the UK, Australia, and Hong Kong, ownership is either restricted or illegal without special exemption.  While Bull Terriers are often friendly, they can become stubborn and aggressive if not well-trained and socialized. The breed‚Äôs tenacity can lead to dangerous behavior if mishandled.  This large, muscular breed is known for its protective instincts. While they can be affectionate with their families, they can show aggression toward strangers, especially without proper socialization. Rottweilers tend to be more aggressive toward strangers, according to some studies.  Originally bred as farm guardians, Boerboels are protective and powerful, which can lead to aggressive behavior if not trained and managed carefully. Ownership of this breed is restricted in many countries including Denmark, Romania, and Qatar.  Akitas are strong-willed and independent, often showing aggression toward other dogs and strangers without proper training. In some regions, the breed is classified as a dangerous dog due to its territorial instincts.  While this hunting breed is typically strong and confident, it can become aggressive if not socialized properly. Ridgebacks may not be ideal for inexperienced dog owners or families with young children.  Pitbulls have a history as fighting dogs, and their physical strength can make them dangerous if not properly trained and socialized. Many countries, including the UK and Australia, have breed-specific legislation banning Pitbulls or restricting ownership.  Known for their intelligence and loyalty, German Shepherds can become aggressive if they feel their family is under threat. This breed is frequently used for police and military work due to its protective nature.  Boxers are energetic and strong, but they can exhibit aggression if they are not properly exercised or trained. They require consistent management to prevent undesirable behavior.  The Cane Corso is a large and dominant breed, known for its guarding instincts. Without proper training and discipline, they can display territorial aggression.  Siberian Huskies are friendly but have a strong prey drive. Without sufficient exercise and training, they can become aggressive or unpredictable, especially when interacting with other animals.  Dobermans are known for their guarding instincts and protective nature. Without proper training, they can be aggressive towards strangers or perceived threats.  Bulldogs can be stubborn and may show aggression if improperly socialized or provoked. Though generally friendly, they can become territorial or aggressive if mishandled.  Bullmastiffs are protective by nature and can become aggressive toward intruders or unfamiliar animals. Their size and strength make them a formidable breed if not properly trained.  Chow Chows can be aloof and territorial. Without proper training, they can become aggressive toward strangers or other dogs. Their independence can sometimes make them difficult to manage.  Basenjis are independent and can show aggression if not socialized properly. Known for their intelligence and independence, they require firm training and early socialization to prevent aggressive behavior.  A mix of Mastiffs and Pitbulls, Bandogs are powerful and can show aggression if not trained properly. These dogs require experienced handlers to prevent aggressive behavior from escalating.  Though affectionate with family, Staffordshire Bull Terriers can be aggressive toward other dogs if not socialized properly. Despite being loving, they require firm management to prevent potential issues.  Neapolitan Mastiffs are massive and protective. If they sense a threat, they can become aggressive. These dogs need firm training and should be handled with care to prevent unwanted aggression. While many of these breeds are associated with aggression, it‚Äôs essential to remember that most dogs are loving and gentle when properly trained and cared for. Aggression typically arises from mishandling, improper training, or a lack of socialization. Dogs, regardless of their breed, are often more likely to be protective and loyal than dangerous. Responsible ownership, proper training, and early socialization play a crucial role in ensuring that dogs, regardless of their breed, remain well-behaved and safe members of society.

The 30-year-old sprinter had hinted earlier this year at the Paris Olympics that she would step away after earning gold, silver, and bronze medals in relay events, contributing to Australia's most successful Summer Games campaign. In a statement confirming her retirement, McKeon expressed mixed emotions, saying, ""I will definitely miss it... It‚Äôs brought me many great relationships and shaped who I am."" However, she added, ""I‚Äôm ready for the next chapter of my life, which I‚Äôm excited for. I haven‚Äôt yet had the chance to fully reflect on everything."" McKeon‚Äôs Olympic journey began in Rio 2016, where she won her first gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay, alongside two relay silvers and a bronze in the 200m freestyle. Her performance at Tokyo 2021 cemented her legacy, with victories in the 100m and 50m freestyle sprints, two relay golds, and three bronze medals ‚Äì the largest medal haul by any athlete at those Games. Australia's swimming coach Rohan Taylor praised McKeon, calling her ""a great role model for younger athletes"" and highlighting her resilience. ""While everyone witnessed her grace, they couldn‚Äôt fully see how tough she is,"" Taylor remarked. Swimming Australia CEO and McKeon‚Äôs uncle, Rob Woodhouse, alongside Taylor, described her victory in the 100m freestyle in Tokyo as a career highlight. In a thrilling race, McKeon edged out Hong Kong‚Äôs Siobhan Haughey by just 0.31 seconds.

In addition to her six Olympic golds and five world titles, McKeon was part of relay teams that set eight world records, three of which still stand. Reflecting on her journey, McKeon recalled missing out on the London Olympics as a teenager but used that experience to inspire others.

Baseball, deeply rooted in Taiwanese culture since its introduction during Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945), is among the nation's most beloved sports. The team secured a decisive 4-0 win against Japan in the final at Tokyo Dome on Sunday, sparking widespread celebrations across Taiwan. President Lai Ching-te praised the players in a phone call shared on Instagram, thanking them for bringing pride to Taiwan and showcasing the island‚Äôs achievements beyond its renowned semiconductor industry. Lai also announced that the team would be greeted at the presidential office following their arrival. Defence Minister Wellington Koo, who watched the match at home, described the victory as a historic moment, adding that the fighter jet salute was a fitting gesture to honour the team's achievement. Large crowds gathered in Taiwan to watch the final on outdoor screens, while businesses and restaurants marked the occasion with special discounts. Some companies, including Trend Micro, declared Monday a holiday in celebration.

A 2018 referendum rejected such a proposal, citing fears that it could provoke China to block the island‚Äôs participation in global events.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511746/kurram-rivals-agree-to-cease-fire-for-7-days,Kurram rivals agree to cease fire for 7 days,"November 25, 2024","PK Govt Jirga brokers deal for return of prisoners and bodies An official Jirga on Sunday negotiated a ceasefire between the warring tribesmen in the Kurram district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), as the death toll from the three days of violence rose to 82, according to the officials in the provincial capital and the embattled district. K-P Information Minister Muhammad Ali Saif said in a statement that a government delegation flew in to Parachinar, Kurram's main town, and met with the rival leaders on Saturday and Sunday to try to broker a ceasefire deal and then move to resolve the matter. The government Jirga had returned to Peshawar from Kurram and ""there have been positive developments in engagements with stakeholders,"" Saif said. ""Both sides have agreed to a ceasefire for seven days and return each other's prisoners and bodies,"" he added. Armed groups in Kurram have been engaged in tribal rivalry for decades over a land dispute in the district located near the Afghanistan border. The latest wave of clashes was triggered after gunmen attacked convoys of civilian vehicles on Thursday, killing dozens of passengers. The roadside pogrom sparked retaliatory attacks against local residents and there have been pitched battles between armed groups from both sides. Armed groups attacked settlements that were populated by members of rival groups. According to the latest information obtained from the local police sources, 12 more people were killed in firing incidents in the district overnight, raising the death toll from clashes to 31 in the last 24 hours, and to 75 in the last three days. However, other media reports put the death toll even higher. ""The clashes and convoy attacks on November 21, 22, and 23 have resulted in 82 fatalities and 156 injuries,"" a local administration official told AFP, while speaking on condition of anonymity. Last night, clashes continued in Bagan, Alizai, Balshakhel, Khar Kalay, Maqbal and Kunj Alizai. The fighting intensified when armed groups of the Turi tribe burned and looted the Lower Kurram villages of Kalu Kunj, Badshah Kot and Bagan Bazaar. In the district, many homes had been evacuated, while markets and schools remain closed. A number of petrol stations had also been set alight, the officials said, adding that gunfights with both light and heavy weapons continued into the night. However, no fresh casualties were reported on Sunday morning. ""The mobile network across Kurram remains suspended and traffic on the main highway is halted,"" said another official. ""Our priority today is to broker a ceasefire between both sides. Once that is achieved, we can begin addressing the underlying issues,"" K-P Law Minister Aftab Alam Afridi told AFP.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511745/three-more-polio-cases-confirmed-1,Three more polio cases confirmed,"November 25, 2024","PK Three more polio cases confirmed In a troubling development, three more polio cases have emerged, taking the total number of polio cases reported so far in the country to 55. The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) has confirmed the detection of three wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases. These cases have emerged from DI Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Zhob and Jaffarabad districts of Balochistan. In DI Khan and Zhob, female children are affected while in Jaffarabad the crippling disease has attacked a male child. DI Khan, one of the seven polio endemic districts of southern K-P, has so far reported six polio cases, while this is the third case this year from Zhob and second from Jaffarabad. Pakistan is responding to an intense resurgence of WPV1 this year. Of the 55 cases reported so far, 26 are from Balochistan, 14 from the K-P, 13 from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Islamabad. Polio is a paralyzing disease that has no cure. Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five are essential to provide children high immunity against this disease. The Pakistan Polio Programme conducts multiple mass vaccination drives in a year, bringing the vaccine to children at their doorsteps, while the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) provides vaccinations against 12 childhood diseases free of charge at health facilities every year. Considering the intense polio outbreak, it is crucial for parents to ensure vaccination for all their children under the age of five to keep them protected.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511744/china-pushes-to-ease-pak-afghan-tensions,China pushes to ease Pak-Afghan tensions,"November 25, 2024","NO Top Chinese diplomat visits Kabul days after Islamabad briefing on TTP threat China seems to have launched a fresh diplomatic effort aimed at defusing brewing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan over the terrorist sanctuaries that Kabul has yet to dismantle despite Islamabad's repeated demands. Following a visit to Islamabad, a top Chinese diplomat dealing with Afghanistan travelled to Kabul over the weekend to meet with the Taliban leadership. China's Special Envoy for Afghanistan Yue Xiaoyong held talks with Afghan Deputy Prime Minister for Political Affairs Maulvi Abdul Kabir, Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub and others. His visit to Kabul came days after he was briefed by authorities in Islamabad on the threat posed by the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other militant groups operating from Afghan soil. Sources said Pakistan conveyed to the envoy that without addressing the terror threat, bilateral relations with Kabul would not move forward. It is believed that the visit of the Chinese envoy to Kabul and Islamabad was part of Beijing's latest push to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. China has in the past attempted to mediate between the estranged countries on the TTP issue, though those efforts yielded no progress. Beijing is worried about the fallout of escalating Pakistan-Afghanistan hostilities on its regional ambitions for greater connectivity and trade. Besides, the persistent presence of terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan also threatens Beijing's interests. Chinese nationals have come under terror attacks in Pakistan. This year at least 7 Chinese nationals were killed in two different terrorist attacks. Pakistan's investigations into the March 26 Besham terrorist attack concluded that there was a network connected to TTP was behind the attack. The probe also revealed that the suicide bomber was an Afghan national and the vehicle used in the attack was smuggled into Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan believes Baloch terrorist groups are now closely working with the TTP and also have their training camps in Afghanistan. However, unlike other countries, China usually follows a carefully crafted policy where such concerns are conveyed from behind closed doors. Officials here believe that they have this understanding that the Chinese envoy forcefully raised the issue of terrorist sanctuaries with the Afghan leadership. A statement issued by the Afghan Deputy Prime Minister's Office indicated that Pakistan, and Afghanistan relationship was one of the subjects of discussions. According to the statement, Mr Yue Xiaoyong commended Afghanistan's progress over the past three years and stressed the significance of fostering improved relations and mutual understanding among Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China. The reference to Pakistan, Afghanistan and China, according to observers, shows that Beijing is keen to see issues between Islamabad and Kabul are sorted out. The Afghan deputy prime minister told the Chinese envoy that the Islamic Emirate has consistently guaranteed its neighbours and the international community that Afghanistan poses no threat to any nation and has upheld this assurance over the past three years. ""The Deputy Prime Minister further noted that Afghanistan is transitioning from a prolonged period of conflict and is prioritizing the revitalisation of its national economy and the expansion of regional cooperation,"" according to the readout, which suggests that the Afghan side tried to placate concerns of China and Pakistan.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511743/pm-tasks-speakers-to-address-ppp-concerns,PM tasks speakers to address PPP concerns,"November 25, 2024","PL PM tasks speakers to address PPP concerns Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has instructed the speakers of the National Assembly and Punjab provincial assembly to take steps to address the concerns raised by the PPP, a party that has been propping up the PML-N led coalition government without actually becoming a part of it. The directive came on Sunday during a consultative session held in Lahore attended by NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan. According to officials, the participants reviewed the current political situation while also discussing the PPP's grievances as well as the PTI's protest march which left for Islamabad on Sunday, raising concerns about potential political instability. On November 22, PM Shehbaz established an 11-member committee after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari voiced frustration over the PML-N leadership's approach to coalition governance. The committee, including Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, and Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Khan Cheema, was tasked with facilitating ""political cooperation and conflict resolution"" between the parties. According to a statement issued from the PM's Office, the committee would work with PPP representatives to outline a path forward through dialogue. Earlier, on Saturday, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, who belongs to the PPP, urged the PM to intervene in order to resolve the differences between the two parties, which have a long history of political confrontation. During his meeting with Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar, the governor had also urged the PML-N led Punjab government to honor its commitment with the PPP, stating that the committee formed by the two parties to resolve issues have yielded no results. Khan said a functional coalition between the PML-N and the PPP would be beneficial for the country, warning that if the coalition government fails, it would primarily harm the PML-N, which currently leads the government. Last week, Bilawal had criticized the PML-N led federal government for failing to honor commitments to the PPP. He alleged that the PML-N government had not consulted with the PPP on policy matters such as the recent crackdown against the Virtual Private Networks (VPNs and restrictions imposed on internet access. He had also expressed concern about the proposed amendments to the IRSA Act to pave the way for construction of more canals on the River Indus.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511742/defiant-pti-marchers-knock-on-capital-door,Defiant PTI marchers knock on capital door,"November 25, 2024","PK Clashes reported from Attock bridge  hundreds arrested The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) embarked on a collision course with the government on Sunday as it finally started marching toward the federal capital after refusing to call off the 'final' protest call given by the imprisoned party founder Imran Khan for his release, among other things. The routes leading to the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi have been closed with containers and heavy contingents of the law-enforcement agencies (LEA) personnel were deployed to meet any eventuality. The PTI rallies from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) led by Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, as well as from different cities of Punjab, began advancing towards the D-Chowk ‚Äì located right in front of the Parliament House in the Red Zone of the federal capital. A large PTI procession from K-P entered Punjab from the Attock bridge, Chach Interchange and Ghazi Barotha Canal. The convoy of vehicles stopped at Ghazi for a while, where Chief Minister Gandapur and Bushra Bibi, wife of Imran Khan, addressed the supporters urging them to move forward. When another convoy, coming from Haripur, reached the Attock Bridge, the police resorted to tear gas shelling. The protesters, meanwhile, set fire to the green belts around them, while a Suzuki van parked at Ghazi Bridge was also torched. A policeman was injured when directly hit by a motorcycle rider. The PTI, after entering Punjab, changed its strategy and directed the convoys coming from the Hazara Division, which had reached Taxila under the leadership of Omar Ayub, to join Gandapur-led convoy. Clashes were also reported from the Isakhel Interchange in Dera Ismail Khan. The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily¬óand denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised. He made it clear that no one would be allowed to disrupt the law and order in the capital, and that the administration, police, and LEAs were prepared to deal with any possible situation. He mentioned that Belarus president's visit was crucial in strengthening relationship between the two countries.

Glen Powell‚Äôs lookalike contest in Austin, Texas, on November 24, was as creative as the actor himself. The winner didn‚Äôt just receive bragging rights but was promised a cameo for their parent or family member in Powell‚Äôs upcoming film‚Äîa prize as unique as the event. Held at Auditorium Shores in Town Lake, the contest drew dozens of Powell‚Äôs lookalikes, but the actor couldn‚Äôt attend in person due to filming commitments in England for The Running Man. Despite his absence, Powell made his presence felt through a Facetime appearance, where he delivered a humorous video message packed with jokes and playful remarks. In his lighthearted video, Powell quipped that the contest was actually for This Is Us actor Justin Hartley‚Äôs lookalike and teased attendees about forming a ‚Äúcriminal Glen-Terprise‚Äù heist. ‚ÄúAnd we don‚Äôt need masks because we all have the same face: It‚Äôs the perfect crime,‚Äù he joked. He also challenged participants to fully commit to the bit, saying, ‚ÄúIf no one is shirtless for no reason, then this whole thing is a sham.‚Äù While his mother and aunt assisted in judging the contest, Powell ensured the highlight was his promise to the winner. He cheekily valued the prize at ‚Äú$6 billion,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúThe winner‚Äôs parent or family member will have a cameo in my next movie.‚Äù Celebrity lookalike contests have grown in popularity, with similar events held for stars like Timoth√©e Chalamet and Harry Styles. However, Powell‚Äôs mix of humor and a quirky, heartfelt prize sets his event apart, showcasing his creative approach to engaging with fans‚Äîeven from thousands of miles away.

Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs appeared upbeat as he entered a New York City courtroom for a bail hearing, hoping to secure his release while facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. The 55-year-old music mogul greeted his family with blown kisses and waves as he entered South Manhattan Federal Court, wearing a beige prison jumpsuit. Unlike previous hearings, he was not shackled and was escorted by US marshals. Family and supporters, including his mother Janice Combs, daughter Chance Combs, son Justin Dior Combs, and adopted son Quincy Brown, attended the hearing on Friday afternoon. The judge deferred the decision on granting him bail, following arguments from prosecutors that Combs could not be ‚Äútrusted‚Äù to follow conditions and might evade legal supervision even with his lawyers‚Äô guidance. Combs is currently detained on a $50 million bond at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, as he awaits his trial. During the hearing, Combs‚Äô legal team pointed to changed circumstances, including new evidence, as reasons to release him, arguing it would allow him to better prepare for his trial scheduled for May 5. Previously, two judges have ruled that he poses a danger to the community and is a flight risk. Assistant US Attorney Christine Slavik stated that Combs‚Äô attempts to contact witnesses from prison, often through family members, demonstrated that he ‚Äúcannot and will not follow rules‚Äù set by his own legal team. ‚ÄúSimply put, the defendant cannot be trusted,‚Äù she said. Slavik further accused Combs‚Äô lawyers of ‚Äúenabling his flouting of rules‚Äù and argued that they had shown an ‚Äúinability to control their client.‚Äù Last week, prosecutors alleged that Combs used jailmates‚Äô phones to intimidate potential witnesses ahead of his trial. According to court documents, he allegedly contacted family members from prison, asking them to reach out to potential victims and craft ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù while making ‚Äúrelentless efforts‚Äù to ‚Äúcorruptly influence witness testimony.‚Äù COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

IShowSpeed‚Äôs adventurous 2024 streaming tour took a bruising turn in New Zealand when he stepped into the cage with UFC veteran Dan Hooker. Known for his bold personality, the streamer visited City Kickboxing, the renowned gym that has produced MMA superstars like Israel Adesanya and Kai Kara-France, but quickly learned the price of challenging an elite fighter. Walking into the gym with his signature confidence, Speed greeted trainers and up-and-coming athletes, declaring, ‚ÄúNobody in here can beat me at boxing.‚Äù After a brief sparring session with an amateur, which left him momentarily shaken, Speed adjusted the rules to better suit his strengths. However, his bravado was tested further when Dan Hooker, a 10-year UFC veteran with 24 wins, entered the cage. Speed, cautious about the UFC star‚Äôs capabilities, insisted, ‚ÄúNo kicking‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs do boxing.‚Äù What followed was a spectacle of endurance and humility. Speed tried to keep his distance, circling the edges of the octagon, but moments of hesitation allowed Hooker to capitalize. The Hangman dropped the streamer multiple times, laughing as he said, ‚ÄúWelcome to my world, brother.‚Äù When Speed protested about a weight difference, Hooker quipped, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lighter than you,‚Äù highlighting the uphill battle Speed faced. Clips of the match, including one where Speed was left clutching his ribs, quickly went viral, with fans praising his courage and laughing at his antics. After the match, Speed admitted, ‚ÄúHe got me good‚Ä¶ I could tell you were going easy on me.‚Äù Hooker returned the compliment on Instagram, calling Speed ‚Äúballs of steel.‚Äù While his UFC dreams may be out of reach, Speed‚Äôs resilience and charisma hint at a promising future in the influencer boxing realm.

During a recent livestream with popular streamer xQc, Drake raised eyebrows with his comments about Steve Lacy, calling him a ""fragile opp"" while acknowledging his music. As Lacy's tracks played in the background, Drake remarked, ‚ÄúThis guy‚Äôs like a fragile opp, but this is a good song though,‚Äù a statement fans quickly linked to Lacy‚Äôs association with Kendrick Lamar. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration with Lamar on tracks like Not Like Us and his presence at Lamar‚Äôs The Pop Out- Ken & Friends concert earlier this year solidified his alliance with the rapper. Their bond is rooted in shared Compton origins, with Lacy openly expressing pride in his hometown and supporting Lamar during his high-profile feud with Drake. A post shared by Shifting Culture (@shiftingculture) Drake‚Äôs comments come amid a backdrop of tension with Kendrick Lamar, who recently released his surprise album GNX. The album, including tracks like Not Like Us and Euphoria, continued to take shots at Drake. Responding to Kendrick‚Äôs diss tracks during the stream, Drake said, ‚ÄúYou need facts to take me out. Fairytales won‚Äôt do it.‚Äù Fans have taken to social media to dissect the remarks, with some viewing them as a playful jab and others interpreting a deeper rivalry. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration on Kendrick‚Äôs PRIDE and his active support for the rapper further fuel speculation about his role in the ongoing feud between the two musical powerhouses. While Drake remains one of the most dominant artists in hip-hop, his remarks during the xQc stream have reignited discussions about alliances and rivalries in the music industry.

When it comes to dog breeds, some stand out for their strength, loyalty, and protective nature. However, a combination of these traits, especially when not managed properly, can lead to aggressive tendencies. While any dog can become aggressive under certain circumstances, there are certain breeds that, due to their history, physical power, or guarding instincts, are more likely to display aggressive behavior if not properly trained and socialized. Understanding these breeds helps ensure responsible pet ownership and safer interactions. Here, we explore 21 of the most dangerous and aggressive dog breeds, highlighting their tendencies and why they may pose a risk if mishandled.  Originally bred as a fighting dog in Japan, the Tosa Inu is large, strong, and protective, making it prone to aggression without proper socialization and training. Due to its potential for aggression, ownership is legally restricted or banned in several countries including the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.  Known for its powerful build and strong prey drive, the Dogo Argentino is territorial and can become aggressive around strangers or unfamiliar animals. This breed has ownership restrictions in several countries, including Australia, Austria, and the UK.  The Fila Brasileiro is fiercely loyal and protective of its territory. It can be highly aggressive towards strangers, requiring firm control and proper training. In countries such as the UK, Australia, and Hong Kong, ownership is either restricted or illegal without special exemption.  While Bull Terriers are often friendly, they can become stubborn and aggressive if not well-trained and socialized. The breed‚Äôs tenacity can lead to dangerous behavior if mishandled.  This large, muscular breed is known for its protective instincts. While they can be affectionate with their families, they can show aggression toward strangers, especially without proper socialization. Rottweilers tend to be more aggressive toward strangers, according to some studies.  Originally bred as farm guardians, Boerboels are protective and powerful, which can lead to aggressive behavior if not trained and managed carefully. Ownership of this breed is restricted in many countries including Denmark, Romania, and Qatar.  Akitas are strong-willed and independent, often showing aggression toward other dogs and strangers without proper training. In some regions, the breed is classified as a dangerous dog due to its territorial instincts.  While this hunting breed is typically strong and confident, it can become aggressive if not socialized properly. Ridgebacks may not be ideal for inexperienced dog owners or families with young children.  Pitbulls have a history as fighting dogs, and their physical strength can make them dangerous if not properly trained and socialized. Many countries, including the UK and Australia, have breed-specific legislation banning Pitbulls or restricting ownership.  Known for their intelligence and loyalty, German Shepherds can become aggressive if they feel their family is under threat. This breed is frequently used for police and military work due to its protective nature.  Boxers are energetic and strong, but they can exhibit aggression if they are not properly exercised or trained. They require consistent management to prevent undesirable behavior.  The Cane Corso is a large and dominant breed, known for its guarding instincts. Without proper training and discipline, they can display territorial aggression.  Siberian Huskies are friendly but have a strong prey drive. Without sufficient exercise and training, they can become aggressive or unpredictable, especially when interacting with other animals.  Dobermans are known for their guarding instincts and protective nature. Without proper training, they can be aggressive towards strangers or perceived threats.  Bulldogs can be stubborn and may show aggression if improperly socialized or provoked. Though generally friendly, they can become territorial or aggressive if mishandled.  Bullmastiffs are protective by nature and can become aggressive toward intruders or unfamiliar animals. Their size and strength make them a formidable breed if not properly trained.  Chow Chows can be aloof and territorial. Without proper training, they can become aggressive toward strangers or other dogs. Their independence can sometimes make them difficult to manage.  Basenjis are independent and can show aggression if not socialized properly. Known for their intelligence and independence, they require firm training and early socialization to prevent aggressive behavior.  A mix of Mastiffs and Pitbulls, Bandogs are powerful and can show aggression if not trained properly. These dogs require experienced handlers to prevent aggressive behavior from escalating.  Though affectionate with family, Staffordshire Bull Terriers can be aggressive toward other dogs if not socialized properly. Despite being loving, they require firm management to prevent potential issues.  Neapolitan Mastiffs are massive and protective. If they sense a threat, they can become aggressive. These dogs need firm training and should be handled with care to prevent unwanted aggression. While many of these breeds are associated with aggression, it‚Äôs essential to remember that most dogs are loving and gentle when properly trained and cared for. Aggression typically arises from mishandling, improper training, or a lack of socialization. Dogs, regardless of their breed, are often more likely to be protective and loyal than dangerous. Responsible ownership, proper training, and early socialization play a crucial role in ensuring that dogs, regardless of their breed, remain well-behaved and safe members of society.

A group of 12 men who were employed by Mohamed Al Fayed have accused the disgraced former Harrods owner of abusive behavior. The men have reported harassment, bullying, and homophobic abuse by Fayed, with some claiming to experience PTSD and ongoing trauma from their time working for him. More than 420 women have also accused Fayed of rape or sexual abuse, with their cases being handled by the Justice for Harrods Survivors group. Discussing the allegations made by male staff, a source told *The Sun*, ""A lot of them have given similar accounts of being bullied, demeaned and being unfairly dismissed or demoted because of Fayed. They often had to leave after speaking up."" Fayed, who passed away in 2023 at the age of 94, was publicly exposed as a sexual abuser in September. Harrods has issued a sincere apology to all the victims. The Metropolitan Police is currently investigating 60 reports of sexual abuse, while Surrey Police is examining one specific alleged incident. Many of Fayed‚Äôs crimes were first uncovered in a 1998 unauthorized biography by journalist Tom Bower. However, additional shocking allegations emerged after a BBC documentary revealed that over 20 former Harrods staff accused Fayed of sexual assault, including rape. Harrods, now under Qatari ownership, expressed being ""utterly appalled"" by the accusations and have ""sincerely"" apologized to the victims.

Rebel Wilson's attempt to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the producers of her directorial debut,The Deb, has been denied by a Los Angeles Superior Court. Judge Thomas Long ruled that the actress‚Äôs claims of sexual harassment and embezzlement, made in an Instagram video and other contexts, do not qualify as protected free speech under California‚Äôs anti-SLAPP statute. The producers, Amanda Ghost, Gregor Cameron, and Vince Holden, allege that Wilson defamed them to gain creative control and force the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Wilson had previously accused the producers of inappropriate behavior toward the film‚Äôs lead actress and embezzling approximately AU $900,000 from the budget. However, lead actress Charlotte MacInnes denied these allegations, stating in court that Wilson‚Äôs claims were baseless and made her feel bullied by the director. While Wilson countersued in October, alleging theft, bullying, and harassment by the producers, her legal team plans to appeal the recent ruling. Camille Vasquez, attorney for the producers, commended the court‚Äôs decision, calling Wilson‚Äôs dismissal motion a ‚Äúcynical attempt‚Äù to suppress valid legal claims.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511805/jon-watts-cancels-wolfs-sequel-after-trust-issues-with-apple-tv,Jon Watts cancels Wolfs sequel after trust issues with Apple TV,"November 25, 2024","US Jon Watts canceled Wolfs sequel, citing Apple's surprise decision to shift from wide theatrical release to streaming. Jon Watts has revealed he scrapped plans for a sequel to Wolfs, starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, citing a loss of trust in Apple. The director explained that the studio‚Äôs last-minute decision to shift the original film from a wide theatrical release to a limited run followed by streaming led to his decision. Watts shared with Deadline that Apple initially praised his final cut of Wolfs and even commissioned a sequel. However, he was blindsided by the pivot to streaming, learning of the change less than a week before the public announcement. ‚ÄúApple didn‚Äôt cancel the sequel‚ÄîI did‚Äîbecause I no longer trusted them as a creative partner,‚Äù Watts stated. Despite his disappointment, he returned the sequel commission to avoid generating negative press during the film‚Äôs release. Watts also expressed frustration with Apple for ignoring his request to exclude the sequel announcement from their press release. ‚ÄúThey used it to create a positive spin on their streaming decision,‚Äù he said, emphasizing that the move came without explanation or discussion. While proud of Wolfs, Watts felt compelled to take a stand for creative transparency. His experience echoes a growing trend in the industry, exemplified by Doug Liman‚Äôs Road House debacle after Amazon acquired MGM. Liman, who had anticipated a theatrical release, saw the project shifted to streaming, which directly affected compensation for him and his team. ‚ÄúWe need streaming, but agreements must be honored,‚Äù Liman said in an interview. While Watts supports streaming as a medium, his experience highlights tensions between creative expectations and shifting studio priorities. Apple has yet to comment on the matter, but Watts‚Äô principled decision underscores the importance of trust in creative partnerships.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511799/pti-convoys-face-tear-gas-as-march-towards-islamabad-continues,PTI convoys face tear gas as march towards Islamabad continues,"November 25, 2024","GB PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar says talks are underway. PTI convoys led by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Opposition leader, Omar Ayub, entered Punjab premises on the call of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan. The convoys, originating from the Hazara Interchange, are heading towards D-Chowk in Islamabad. As the convoys advanced, they encountered heavy resistance from the police at the Ghazi Brotha Bridge, where intense shelling was reported. Despite the police crackdown, Omar Ayub's convoy managed to push back Punjab Police forces at the Hazara Interchange. Ali Amin Gandapur, who is leading the Hazara Division convoy, played a crucial role in helping the convoy break through the police barricades. After overcoming the police blockade, the convoys continued their journey, with vehicles stretching over two kilometers as they moved forward. On the Hazara Motorway, PTI supporters successfully forced police to retreat, with reports of violent clashes and heavy stone-pelting. Several police personnel were injured in the scuffles, and two officers were severely wounded and transferred to hospitals. Among the injured officers were DSPs Chaudhry Zulfiqar and Shahid Gilani, as well as ASI Tabassum. DSP Zulfiqar suffered significant injuries to his back and legs during the confrontation. 'Talks underway' Barrister Gohar Khan and Saif held a 90-minute meeting with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi. Following the meeting, Barrister Gohar described the discussion as significant, confirming that Imran Khan‚Äôs call for a protest remains final and that rumors about it being canceled were untrue. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Barrister Gohar emphasised that the PTI founder‚Äôs stance on the protest was unchanged, and the movement would proceed as planned. The meeting focused on strategic discussions regarding the ongoing political situation and the party's future course of action. When asked about the ongoing negotiations surrounding the protest, Barrister Gohar assured reporters that updates would be provided in due course. He further confirmed that discussions were still ongoing but did not offer further details at this time. 'Final call' The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. Internet services suspension The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily and denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. Several leaders arrested A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised.

Glen Powell‚Äôs lookalike contest in Austin, Texas, on November 24, was as creative as the actor himself. The winner didn‚Äôt just receive bragging rights but was promised a cameo for their parent or family member in Powell‚Äôs upcoming film‚Äîa prize as unique as the event. Held at Auditorium Shores in Town Lake, the contest drew dozens of Powell‚Äôs lookalikes, but the actor couldn‚Äôt attend in person due to filming commitments in England for The Running Man. Despite his absence, Powell made his presence felt through a Facetime appearance, where he delivered a humorous video message packed with jokes and playful remarks.

He cheekily valued the prize at ‚Äú$6 billion,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúThe winner‚Äôs parent or family member will have a cameo in my next movie.‚Äù Celebrity lookalike contests have grown in popularity, with similar events held for stars like Timoth√©e Chalamet and Harry Styles.

Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs appeared upbeat as he entered a New York City courtroom for a bail hearing, hoping to secure his release while facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. The 55-year-old music mogul greeted his family with blown kisses and waves as he entered South Manhattan Federal Court, wearing a beige prison jumpsuit. Unlike previous hearings, he was not shackled and was escorted by US marshals. Family and supporters, including his mother Janice Combs, daughter Chance Combs, son Justin Dior Combs, and adopted son Quincy Brown, attended the hearing on Friday afternoon. The judge deferred the decision on granting him bail, following arguments from prosecutors that Combs could not be ‚Äútrusted‚Äù to follow conditions and might evade legal supervision even with his lawyers‚Äô guidance. Combs is currently detained on a $50 million bond at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, as he awaits his trial. During the hearing, Combs‚Äô legal team pointed to changed circumstances, including new evidence, as reasons to release him, arguing it would allow him to better prepare for his trial scheduled for May 5. Previously, two judges have ruled that he poses a danger to the community and is a flight risk. Assistant US Attorney Christine Slavik stated that Combs‚Äô attempts to contact witnesses from prison, often through family members, demonstrated that he ‚Äúcannot and will not follow rules‚Äù set by his own legal team. ‚ÄúSimply put, the defendant cannot be trusted,‚Äù she said. Slavik further accused Combs‚Äô lawyers of ‚Äúenabling his flouting of rules‚Äù and argued that they had shown an ‚Äúinability to control their client.‚Äù Last week, prosecutors alleged that Combs used jailmates‚Äô phones to intimidate potential witnesses ahead of his trial. According to court documents, he allegedly contacted family members from prison, asking them to reach out to potential victims and craft ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù while making ‚Äúrelentless efforts‚Äù to ‚Äúcorruptly influence witness testimony.‚Äù COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511799/pti-convoys-face-tear-gas-as-march-towards-islamabad-continues,PTI convoys face tear gas as march towards Islamabad continues,"November 25, 2024","GB PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar says talks are underway. PTI convoys led by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Opposition leader, Omar Ayub, entered Punjab premises on the call of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan. The convoys, originating from the Hazara Interchange, are heading towards D-Chowk in Islamabad. As the convoys advanced, they encountered heavy resistance from the police at the Ghazi Brotha Bridge, where intense shelling was reported. Despite the police crackdown, Omar Ayub's convoy managed to push back Punjab Police forces at the Hazara Interchange. Ali Amin Gandapur, who is leading the Hazara Division convoy, played a crucial role in helping the convoy break through the police barricades. After overcoming the police blockade, the convoys continued their journey, with vehicles stretching over two kilometers as they moved forward. On the Hazara Motorway, PTI supporters successfully forced police to retreat, with reports of violent clashes and heavy stone-pelting. Several police personnel were injured in the scuffles, and two officers were severely wounded and transferred to hospitals. Among the injured officers were DSPs Chaudhry Zulfiqar and Shahid Gilani, as well as ASI Tabassum. DSP Zulfiqar suffered significant injuries to his back and legs during the confrontation. 'Talks underway' Barrister Gohar Khan and Saif held a 90-minute meeting with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi. Following the meeting, Barrister Gohar described the discussion as significant, confirming that Imran Khan‚Äôs call for a protest remains final and that rumors about it being canceled were untrue. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Barrister Gohar emphasised that the PTI founder‚Äôs stance on the protest was unchanged, and the movement would proceed as planned. The meeting focused on strategic discussions regarding the ongoing political situation and the party's future course of action. When asked about the ongoing negotiations surrounding the protest, Barrister Gohar assured reporters that updates would be provided in due course. He further confirmed that discussions were still ongoing but did not offer further details at this time. 'Final call' The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. Internet services suspension The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily and denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. Several leaders arrested A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised.

IShowSpeed‚Äôs adventurous 2024 streaming tour took a bruising turn in New Zealand when he stepped into the cage with UFC veteran Dan Hooker. Known for his bold personality, the streamer visited City Kickboxing, the renowned gym that has produced MMA superstars like Israel Adesanya and Kai Kara-France, but quickly learned the price of challenging an elite fighter. Walking into the gym with his signature confidence, Speed greeted trainers and up-and-coming athletes, declaring, ‚ÄúNobody in here can beat me at boxing.‚Äù After a brief sparring session with an amateur, which left him momentarily shaken, Speed adjusted the rules to better suit his strengths. However, his bravado was tested further when Dan Hooker, a 10-year UFC veteran with 24 wins, entered the cage. Speed, cautious about the UFC star‚Äôs capabilities, insisted, ‚ÄúNo kicking‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs do boxing.‚Äù What followed was a spectacle of endurance and humility. Speed tried to keep his distance, circling the edges of the octagon, but moments of hesitation allowed Hooker to capitalize. The Hangman dropped the streamer multiple times, laughing as he said, ‚ÄúWelcome to my world, brother.‚Äù When Speed protested about a weight difference, Hooker quipped, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lighter than you,‚Äù highlighting the uphill battle Speed faced. Clips of the match, including one where Speed was left clutching his ribs, quickly went viral, with fans praising his courage and laughing at his antics. After the match, Speed admitted, ‚ÄúHe got me good‚Ä¶ I could tell you were going easy on me.‚Äù Hooker returned the compliment on Instagram, calling Speed ‚Äúballs of steel.‚Äù While his UFC dreams may be out of reach, Speed‚Äôs resilience and charisma hint at a promising future in the influencer boxing realm.

During a recent livestream with popular streamer xQc, Drake raised eyebrows with his comments about Steve Lacy, calling him a ""fragile opp"" while acknowledging his music. As Lacy's tracks played in the background, Drake remarked, ‚ÄúThis guy‚Äôs like a fragile opp, but this is a good song though,‚Äù a statement fans quickly linked to Lacy‚Äôs association with Kendrick Lamar. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration with Lamar on tracks like Not Like Us and his presence at Lamar‚Äôs The Pop Out- Ken & Friends concert earlier this year solidified his alliance with the rapper. Their bond is rooted in shared Compton origins, with Lacy openly expressing pride in his hometown and supporting Lamar during his high-profile feud with Drake. A post shared by Shifting Culture (@shiftingculture) Drake‚Äôs comments come amid a backdrop of tension with Kendrick Lamar, who recently released his surprise album GNX. The album, including tracks like Not Like Us and Euphoria, continued to take shots at Drake. Responding to Kendrick‚Äôs diss tracks during the stream, Drake said, ‚ÄúYou need facts to take me out. Fairytales won‚Äôt do it.‚Äù Fans have taken to social media to dissect the remarks, with some viewing them as a playful jab and others interpreting a deeper rivalry. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration on Kendrick‚Äôs PRIDE and his active support for the rapper further fuel speculation about his role in the ongoing feud between the two musical powerhouses. While Drake remains one of the most dominant artists in hip-hop, his remarks during the xQc stream have reignited discussions about alliances and rivalries in the music industry.

When it comes to dog breeds, some stand out for their strength, loyalty, and protective nature. However, a combination of these traits, especially when not managed properly, can lead to aggressive tendencies. While any dog can become aggressive under certain circumstances, there are certain breeds that, due to their history, physical power, or guarding instincts, are more likely to display aggressive behavior if not properly trained and socialized. Understanding these breeds helps ensure responsible pet ownership and safer interactions. Here, we explore 21 of the most dangerous and aggressive dog breeds, highlighting their tendencies and why they may pose a risk if mishandled.  Originally bred as a fighting dog in Japan, the Tosa Inu is large, strong, and protective, making it prone to aggression without proper socialization and training. Due to its potential for aggression, ownership is legally restricted or banned in several countries including the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.  Known for its powerful build and strong prey drive, the Dogo Argentino is territorial and can become aggressive around strangers or unfamiliar animals. This breed has ownership restrictions in several countries, including Australia, Austria, and the UK.  The Fila Brasileiro is fiercely loyal and protective of its territory. It can be highly aggressive towards strangers, requiring firm control and proper training. In countries such as the UK, Australia, and Hong Kong, ownership is either restricted or illegal without special exemption.  While Bull Terriers are often friendly, they can become stubborn and aggressive if not well-trained and socialized. The breed‚Äôs tenacity can lead to dangerous behavior if mishandled.  This large, muscular breed is known for its protective instincts. While they can be affectionate with their families, they can show aggression toward strangers, especially without proper socialization. Rottweilers tend to be more aggressive toward strangers, according to some studies.  Originally bred as farm guardians, Boerboels are protective and powerful, which can lead to aggressive behavior if not trained and managed carefully. Ownership of this breed is restricted in many countries including Denmark, Romania, and Qatar.  Akitas are strong-willed and independent, often showing aggression toward other dogs and strangers without proper training. In some regions, the breed is classified as a dangerous dog due to its territorial instincts.  While this hunting breed is typically strong and confident, it can become aggressive if not socialized properly. Ridgebacks may not be ideal for inexperienced dog owners or families with young children.  Pitbulls have a history as fighting dogs, and their physical strength can make them dangerous if not properly trained and socialized. Many countries, including the UK and Australia, have breed-specific legislation banning Pitbulls or restricting ownership.  Known for their intelligence and loyalty, German Shepherds can become aggressive if they feel their family is under threat. This breed is frequently used for police and military work due to its protective nature.  Boxers are energetic and strong, but they can exhibit aggression if they are not properly exercised or trained. They require consistent management to prevent undesirable behavior.  The Cane Corso is a large and dominant breed, known for its guarding instincts. Without proper training and discipline, they can display territorial aggression.  Siberian Huskies are friendly but have a strong prey drive. Without sufficient exercise and training, they can become aggressive or unpredictable, especially when interacting with other animals.  Dobermans are known for their guarding instincts and protective nature. Without proper training, they can be aggressive towards strangers or perceived threats.  Bulldogs can be stubborn and may show aggression if improperly socialized or provoked. Though generally friendly, they can become territorial or aggressive if mishandled.  Bullmastiffs are protective by nature and can become aggressive toward intruders or unfamiliar animals. Their size and strength make them a formidable breed if not properly trained.  Chow Chows can be aloof and territorial. Without proper training, they can become aggressive toward strangers or other dogs. Their independence can sometimes make them difficult to manage.  Basenjis are independent and can show aggression if not socialized properly. Known for their intelligence and independence, they require firm training and early socialization to prevent aggressive behavior.  A mix of Mastiffs and Pitbulls, Bandogs are powerful and can show aggression if not trained properly. These dogs require experienced handlers to prevent aggressive behavior from escalating.  Though affectionate with family, Staffordshire Bull Terriers can be aggressive toward other dogs if not socialized properly. Despite being loving, they require firm management to prevent potential issues.  Neapolitan Mastiffs are massive and protective. If they sense a threat, they can become aggressive. These dogs need firm training and should be handled with care to prevent unwanted aggression. While many of these breeds are associated with aggression, it‚Äôs essential to remember that most dogs are loving and gentle when properly trained and cared for. Aggression typically arises from mishandling, improper training, or a lack of socialization. Dogs, regardless of their breed, are often more likely to be protective and loyal than dangerous. Responsible ownership, proper training, and early socialization play a crucial role in ensuring that dogs, regardless of their breed, remain well-behaved and safe members of society.

Rebel Wilson's attempt to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the producers of her directorial debut,The Deb, has been denied by a Los Angeles Superior Court. Judge Thomas Long ruled that the actress‚Äôs claims of sexual harassment and embezzlement, made in an Instagram video and other contexts, do not qualify as protected free speech under California‚Äôs anti-SLAPP statute. The producers, Amanda Ghost, Gregor Cameron, and Vince Holden, allege that Wilson defamed them to gain creative control and force the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Wilson had previously accused the producers of inappropriate behavior toward the film‚Äôs lead actress and embezzling approximately AU $900,000 from the budget. However, lead actress Charlotte MacInnes denied these allegations, stating in court that Wilson‚Äôs claims were baseless and made her feel bullied by the director. While Wilson countersued in October, alleging theft, bullying, and harassment by the producers, her legal team plans to appeal the recent ruling. Camille Vasquez, attorney for the producers, commended the court‚Äôs decision, calling Wilson‚Äôs dismissal motion a ‚Äúcynical attempt‚Äù to suppress valid legal claims.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511805/jon-watts-cancels-wolfs-sequel-after-trust-issues-with-apple-tv,Jon Watts cancels Wolfs sequel after trust issues with Apple TV,"November 25, 2024","US Jon Watts canceled Wolfs sequel, citing Apple's surprise decision to shift from wide theatrical release to streaming. Jon Watts has revealed he scrapped plans for a sequel to Wolfs, starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, citing a loss of trust in Apple. The director explained that the studio‚Äôs last-minute decision to shift the original film from a wide theatrical release to a limited run followed by streaming led to his decision. Watts shared with Deadline that Apple initially praised his final cut of Wolfs and even commissioned a sequel. However, he was blindsided by the pivot to streaming, learning of the change less than a week before the public announcement. ‚ÄúApple didn‚Äôt cancel the sequel‚ÄîI did‚Äîbecause I no longer trusted them as a creative partner,‚Äù Watts stated. Despite his disappointment, he returned the sequel commission to avoid generating negative press during the film‚Äôs release. Watts also expressed frustration with Apple for ignoring his request to exclude the sequel announcement from their press release. ‚ÄúThey used it to create a positive spin on their streaming decision,‚Äù he said, emphasizing that the move came without explanation or discussion. While proud of Wolfs, Watts felt compelled to take a stand for creative transparency. His experience echoes a growing trend in the industry, exemplified by Doug Liman‚Äôs Road House debacle after Amazon acquired MGM. Liman, who had anticipated a theatrical release, saw the project shifted to streaming, which directly affected compensation for him and his team. ‚ÄúWe need streaming, but agreements must be honored,‚Äù Liman said in an interview. While Watts supports streaming as a medium, his experience highlights tensions between creative expectations and shifting studio priorities. Apple has yet to comment on the matter, but Watts‚Äô principled decision underscores the importance of trust in creative partnerships.

Glen Powell‚Äôs lookalike contest in Austin, Texas, on November 24, was as creative as the actor himself. The winner didn‚Äôt just receive bragging rights but was promised a cameo for their parent or family member in Powell‚Äôs upcoming film‚Äîa prize as unique as the event. Held at Auditorium Shores in Town Lake, the contest drew dozens of Powell‚Äôs lookalikes, but the actor couldn‚Äôt attend in person due to filming commitments in England for The Running Man. Despite his absence, Powell made his presence felt through a Facetime appearance, where he delivered a humorous video message packed with jokes and playful remarks. In his lighthearted video, Powell quipped that the contest was actually for This Is Us actor Justin Hartley‚Äôs lookalike and teased attendees about forming a ‚Äúcriminal Glen-Terprise‚Äù heist. ‚ÄúAnd we don‚Äôt need masks because we all have the same face: It‚Äôs the perfect crime,‚Äù he joked. He also challenged participants to fully commit to the bit, saying, ‚ÄúIf no one is shirtless for no reason, then this whole thing is a sham.‚Äù While his mother and aunt assisted in judging the contest, Powell ensured the highlight was his promise to the winner. He cheekily valued the prize at ‚Äú$6 billion,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúThe winner‚Äôs parent or family member will have a cameo in my next movie.‚Äù Celebrity lookalike contests have grown in popularity, with similar events held for stars like Timoth√©e Chalamet and Harry Styles.

Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs appeared upbeat as he entered a New York City courtroom for a bail hearing, hoping to secure his release while facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. The 55-year-old music mogul greeted his family with blown kisses and waves as he entered South Manhattan Federal Court, wearing a beige prison jumpsuit. Unlike previous hearings, he was not shackled and was escorted by US marshals. Family and supporters, including his mother Janice Combs, daughter Chance Combs, son Justin Dior Combs, and adopted son Quincy Brown, attended the hearing on Friday afternoon. The judge deferred the decision on granting him bail, following arguments from prosecutors that Combs could not be ‚Äútrusted‚Äù to follow conditions and might evade legal supervision even with his lawyers‚Äô guidance. Combs is currently detained on a $50 million bond at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, as he awaits his trial. During the hearing, Combs‚Äô legal team pointed to changed circumstances, including new evidence, as reasons to release him, arguing it would allow him to better prepare for his trial scheduled for May 5. Previously, two judges have ruled that he poses a danger to the community and is a flight risk. Assistant US Attorney Christine Slavik stated that Combs‚Äô attempts to contact witnesses from prison, often through family members, demonstrated that he ‚Äúcannot and will not follow rules‚Äù set by his own legal team. ‚ÄúSimply put, the defendant cannot be trusted,‚Äù she said. Slavik further accused Combs‚Äô lawyers of ‚Äúenabling his flouting of rules‚Äù and argued that they had shown an ‚Äúinability to control their client.‚Äù Last week, prosecutors alleged that Combs used jailmates‚Äô phones to intimidate potential witnesses ahead of his trial. According to court documents, he allegedly contacted family members from prison, asking them to reach out to potential victims and craft ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù while making ‚Äúrelentless efforts‚Äù to ‚Äúcorruptly influence witness testimony.‚Äù COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511799/pti-convoys-face-tear-gas-as-march-towards-islamabad-continues,PTI convoys face tear gas as march towards Islamabad continues,"November 25, 2024","PK PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar says talks are underway. PTI convoys led by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Opposition leader, Omar Ayub, entered Punjab premises on the call of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan. The convoys, originating from the Hazara Interchange, are heading towards D-Chowk in Islamabad. As the convoys advanced, they encountered heavy resistance from the police at the Ghazi Brotha Bridge, where intense shelling was reported. Despite the police crackdown, Omar Ayub's convoy managed to push back Punjab Police forces at the Hazara Interchange. Ali Amin Gandapur, who is leading the Hazara Division convoy, played a crucial role in helping the convoy break through the police barricades. After overcoming the police blockade, the convoys continued their journey, with vehicles stretching over two kilometers as they moved forward. On the Hazara Motorway, PTI supporters successfully forced police to retreat, with reports of violent clashes and heavy stone-pelting. Several police personnel were injured in the scuffles, and two officers were severely wounded and transferred to hospitals. Among the injured officers were DSPs Chaudhry Zulfiqar and Shahid Gilani, as well as ASI Tabassum. DSP Zulfiqar suffered significant injuries to his back and legs during the confrontation. 'Talks underway' Barrister Gohar Khan and Saif held a 90-minute meeting with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi. Following the meeting, Barrister Gohar described the discussion as significant, confirming that Imran Khan‚Äôs call for a protest remains final and that rumors about it being canceled were untrue. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Barrister Gohar emphasised that the PTI founder‚Äôs stance on the protest was unchanged, and the movement would proceed as planned. The meeting focused on strategic discussions regarding the ongoing political situation and the party's future course of action. When asked about the ongoing negotiations surrounding the protest, Barrister Gohar assured reporters that updates would be provided in due course. He further confirmed that discussions were still ongoing but did not offer further details at this time. 'Final call' The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. Internet services suspension The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily and denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. Several leaders arrested A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised.

IShowSpeed‚Äôs adventurous 2024 streaming tour took a bruising turn in New Zealand when he stepped into the cage with UFC veteran Dan Hooker. Known for his bold personality, the streamer visited City Kickboxing, the renowned gym that has produced MMA superstars like Israel Adesanya and Kai Kara-France, but quickly learned the price of challenging an elite fighter. Walking into the gym with his signature confidence, Speed greeted trainers and up-and-coming athletes, declaring, ‚ÄúNobody in here can beat me at boxing.‚Äù After a brief sparring session with an amateur, which left him momentarily shaken, Speed adjusted the rules to better suit his strengths. However, his bravado was tested further when Dan Hooker, a 10-year UFC veteran with 24 wins, entered the cage. Speed, cautious about the UFC star‚Äôs capabilities, insisted, ‚ÄúNo kicking‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs do boxing.‚Äù What followed was a spectacle of endurance and humility. Speed tried to keep his distance, circling the edges of the octagon, but moments of hesitation allowed Hooker to capitalize. The Hangman dropped the streamer multiple times, laughing as he said, ‚ÄúWelcome to my world, brother.‚Äù When Speed protested about a weight difference, Hooker quipped, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lighter than you,‚Äù highlighting the uphill battle Speed faced. Clips of the match, including one where Speed was left clutching his ribs, quickly went viral, with fans praising his courage and laughing at his antics. After the match, Speed admitted, ‚ÄúHe got me good‚Ä¶ I could tell you were going easy on me.‚Äù Hooker returned the compliment on Instagram, calling Speed ‚Äúballs of steel.‚Äù While his UFC dreams may be out of reach, Speed‚Äôs resilience and charisma hint at a promising future in the influencer boxing realm.

During a recent livestream with popular streamer xQc, Drake raised eyebrows with his comments about Steve Lacy, calling him a ""fragile opp"" while acknowledging his music. As Lacy's tracks played in the background, Drake remarked, ‚ÄúThis guy‚Äôs like a fragile opp, but this is a good song though,‚Äù a statement fans quickly linked to Lacy‚Äôs association with Kendrick Lamar. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration with Lamar on tracks like Not Like Us and his presence at Lamar‚Äôs The Pop Out- Ken & Friends concert earlier this year solidified his alliance with the rapper. Their bond is rooted in shared Compton origins, with Lacy openly expressing pride in his hometown and supporting Lamar during his high-profile feud with Drake. A post shared by Shifting Culture (@shiftingculture) Drake‚Äôs comments come amid a backdrop of tension with Kendrick Lamar, who recently released his surprise album GNX. The album, including tracks like Not Like Us and Euphoria, continued to take shots at Drake. Responding to Kendrick‚Äôs diss tracks during the stream, Drake said, ‚ÄúYou need facts to take me out. Fairytales won‚Äôt do it.‚Äù Fans have taken to social media to dissect the remarks, with some viewing them as a playful jab and others interpreting a deeper rivalry. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration on Kendrick‚Äôs PRIDE and his active support for the rapper further fuel speculation about his role in the ongoing feud between the two musical powerhouses. While Drake remains one of the most dominant artists in hip-hop, his remarks during the xQc stream have reignited discussions about alliances and rivalries in the music industry.

The 30-year-old sprinter had hinted earlier this year at the Paris Olympics that she would step away after earning gold, silver, and bronze medals in relay events, contributing to Australia's most successful Summer Games campaign. In a statement confirming her retirement, McKeon expressed mixed emotions, saying, ""I will definitely miss it... It‚Äôs brought me many great relationships and shaped who I am."" However, she added, ""I‚Äôm ready for the next chapter of my life, which I‚Äôm excited for. I haven‚Äôt yet had the chance to fully reflect on everything."" McKeon‚Äôs Olympic journey began in Rio 2016, where she won her first gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay, alongside two relay silvers and a bronze in the 200m freestyle. Her performance at Tokyo 2021 cemented her legacy, with victories in the 100m and 50m freestyle sprints, two relay golds, and three bronze medals ‚Äì the largest medal haul by any athlete at those Games. Australia's swimming coach Rohan Taylor praised McKeon, calling her ""a great role model for younger athletes"" and highlighting her resilience. ""While everyone witnessed her grace, they couldn‚Äôt fully see how tough she is,"" Taylor remarked. Swimming Australia CEO and McKeon‚Äôs uncle, Rob Woodhouse, alongside Taylor, described her victory in the 100m freestyle in Tokyo as a career highlight. In a thrilling race, McKeon edged out Hong Kong‚Äôs Siobhan Haughey by just 0.31 seconds. ""It was one of the greatest races I‚Äôve ever seen,"" Woodhouse commented, also commending McKeon for mentoring younger swimmers. In addition to her six Olympic golds and five world titles, McKeon was part of relay teams that set eight world records, three of which still stand. Reflecting on her journey, McKeon recalled missing out on the London Olympics as a teenager but used that experience to inspire others. ""You have ups and downs, but you keep going and ticking the boxes,"" she said. ""I hope my story shows young athletes that I was once in their position ‚Äì dreaming of achieving something big.""

Baseball, deeply rooted in Taiwanese culture since its introduction during Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945), is among the nation's most beloved sports. The team secured a decisive 4-0 win against Japan in the final at Tokyo Dome on Sunday, sparking widespread celebrations across Taiwan. President Lai Ching-te praised the players in a phone call shared on Instagram, thanking them for bringing pride to Taiwan and showcasing the island‚Äôs achievements beyond its renowned semiconductor industry. Lai also announced that the team would be greeted at the presidential office following their arrival. Defence Minister Wellington Koo, who watched the match at home, described the victory as a historic moment, adding that the fighter jet salute was a fitting gesture to honour the team's achievement. Large crowds gathered in Taiwan to watch the final on outdoor screens, while businesses and restaurants marked the occasion with special discounts. Some companies, including Trend Micro, declared Monday a holiday in celebration. Taiwan participated in the championship under the name ""Chinese Taipei,"" a designation used in most international sporting events to sidestep political tensions with China, which claims the island as its territory. The naming issue has been a contentious topic in Taiwan, with some advocating for the use of ""Taiwan"" in international competitions. A 2018 referendum rejected such a proposal, citing fears that it could provoke China to block the island‚Äôs participation in global events. In Tokyo, Taiwanese fan Wang Ming-chang expressed hope for change, saying, ""Taiwan is our country, and we want to compete under the name of Taiwan in international events.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511746/kurram-rivals-agree-to-cease-fire-for-7-days,Kurram rivals agree to cease fire for 7 days,"November 25, 2024","PL Govt Jirga brokers deal for return of prisoners and bodies An official Jirga on Sunday negotiated a ceasefire between the warring tribesmen in the Kurram district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), as the death toll from the three days of violence rose to 82, according to the officials in the provincial capital and the embattled district. K-P Information Minister Muhammad Ali Saif said in a statement that a government delegation flew in to Parachinar, Kurram's main town, and met with the rival leaders on Saturday and Sunday to try to broker a ceasefire deal and then move to resolve the matter. The government Jirga had returned to Peshawar from Kurram and ""there have been positive developments in engagements with stakeholders,"" Saif said. ""Both sides have agreed to a ceasefire for seven days and return each other's prisoners and bodies,"" he added. Armed groups in Kurram have been engaged in tribal rivalry for decades over a land dispute in the district located near the Afghanistan border. The latest wave of clashes was triggered after gunmen attacked convoys of civilian vehicles on Thursday, killing dozens of passengers. The roadside pogrom sparked retaliatory attacks against local residents and there have been pitched battles between armed groups from both sides. Armed groups attacked settlements that were populated by members of rival groups. According to the latest information obtained from the local police sources, 12 more people were killed in firing incidents in the district overnight, raising the death toll from clashes to 31 in the last 24 hours, and to 75 in the last three days. However, other media reports put the death toll even higher. ""The clashes and convoy attacks on November 21, 22, and 23 have resulted in 82 fatalities and 156 injuries,"" a local administration official told AFP, while speaking on condition of anonymity. Last night, clashes continued in Bagan, Alizai, Balshakhel, Khar Kalay, Maqbal and Kunj Alizai. The fighting intensified when armed groups of the Turi tribe burned and looted the Lower Kurram villages of Kalu Kunj, Badshah Kot and Bagan Bazaar. In the district, many homes had been evacuated, while markets and schools remain closed. A number of petrol stations had also been set alight, the officials said, adding that gunfights with both light and heavy weapons continued into the night. However, no fresh casualties were reported on Sunday morning. ""The mobile network across Kurram remains suspended and traffic on the main highway is halted,"" said another official. ""Our priority today is to broker a ceasefire between both sides. Once that is achieved, we can begin addressing the underlying issues,"" K-P Law Minister Aftab Alam Afridi told AFP.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511745/three-more-polio-cases-confirmed-1,Three more polio cases confirmed,"November 25, 2024","US Three more polio cases confirmed In a troubling development, three more polio cases have emerged, taking the total number of polio cases reported so far in the country to 55. The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) has confirmed the detection of three wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases. These cases have emerged from DI Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Zhob and Jaffarabad districts of Balochistan. In DI Khan and Zhob, female children are affected while in Jaffarabad the crippling disease has attacked a male child. DI Khan, one of the seven polio endemic districts of southern K-P, has so far reported six polio cases, while this is the third case this year from Zhob and second from Jaffarabad. Pakistan is responding to an intense resurgence of WPV1 this year. Of the 55 cases reported so far, 26 are from Balochistan, 14 from the K-P, 13 from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Islamabad. Polio is a paralyzing disease that has no cure. Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five are essential to provide children high immunity against this disease. The Pakistan Polio Programme conducts multiple mass vaccination drives in a year, bringing the vaccine to children at their doorsteps, while the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) provides vaccinations against 12 childhood diseases free of charge at health facilities every year. Considering the intense polio outbreak, it is crucial for parents to ensure vaccination for all their children under the age of five to keep them protected.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511744/china-pushes-to-ease-pak-afghan-tensions,China pushes to ease Pak-Afghan tensions,"November 25, 2024","PK Top Chinese diplomat visits Kabul days after Islamabad briefing on TTP threat China seems to have launched a fresh diplomatic effort aimed at defusing brewing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan over the terrorist sanctuaries that Kabul has yet to dismantle despite Islamabad's repeated demands. Following a visit to Islamabad, a top Chinese diplomat dealing with Afghanistan travelled to Kabul over the weekend to meet with the Taliban leadership. China's Special Envoy for Afghanistan Yue Xiaoyong held talks with Afghan Deputy Prime Minister for Political Affairs Maulvi Abdul Kabir, Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub and others. His visit to Kabul came days after he was briefed by authorities in Islamabad on the threat posed by the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other militant groups operating from Afghan soil. Sources said Pakistan conveyed to the envoy that without addressing the terror threat, bilateral relations with Kabul would not move forward. It is believed that the visit of the Chinese envoy to Kabul and Islamabad was part of Beijing's latest push to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. China has in the past attempted to mediate between the estranged countries on the TTP issue, though those efforts yielded no progress. Beijing is worried about the fallout of escalating Pakistan-Afghanistan hostilities on its regional ambitions for greater connectivity and trade. Besides, the persistent presence of terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan also threatens Beijing's interests. Chinese nationals have come under terror attacks in Pakistan. This year at least 7 Chinese nationals were killed in two different terrorist attacks. Pakistan's investigations into the March 26 Besham terrorist attack concluded that there was a network connected to TTP was behind the attack. The probe also revealed that the suicide bomber was an Afghan national and the vehicle used in the attack was smuggled into Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan believes Baloch terrorist groups are now closely working with the TTP and also have their training camps in Afghanistan. However, unlike other countries, China usually follows a carefully crafted policy where such concerns are conveyed from behind closed doors. Officials here believe that they have this understanding that the Chinese envoy forcefully raised the issue of terrorist sanctuaries with the Afghan leadership. A statement issued by the Afghan Deputy Prime Minister's Office indicated that Pakistan, and Afghanistan relationship was one of the subjects of discussions. According to the statement, Mr Yue Xiaoyong commended Afghanistan's progress over the past three years and stressed the significance of fostering improved relations and mutual understanding among Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China. The reference to Pakistan, Afghanistan and China, according to observers, shows that Beijing is keen to see issues between Islamabad and Kabul are sorted out. The Afghan deputy prime minister told the Chinese envoy that the Islamic Emirate has consistently guaranteed its neighbours and the international community that Afghanistan poses no threat to any nation and has upheld this assurance over the past three years. ""The Deputy Prime Minister further noted that Afghanistan is transitioning from a prolonged period of conflict and is prioritizing the revitalisation of its national economy and the expansion of regional cooperation,"" according to the readout, which suggests that the Afghan side tried to placate concerns of China and Pakistan.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511743/pm-tasks-speakers-to-address-ppp-concerns,PM tasks speakers to address PPP concerns,"November 25, 2024","US PM tasks speakers to address PPP concerns Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has instructed the speakers of the National Assembly and Punjab provincial assembly to take steps to address the concerns raised by the PPP, a party that has been propping up the PML-N led coalition government without actually becoming a part of it. The directive came on Sunday during a consultative session held in Lahore attended by NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan. According to officials, the participants reviewed the current political situation while also discussing the PPP's grievances as well as the PTI's protest march which left for Islamabad on Sunday, raising concerns about potential political instability. On November 22, PM Shehbaz established an 11-member committee after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari voiced frustration over the PML-N leadership's approach to coalition governance. The committee, including Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, and Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Khan Cheema, was tasked with facilitating ""political cooperation and conflict resolution"" between the parties. According to a statement issued from the PM's Office, the committee would work with PPP representatives to outline a path forward through dialogue. Earlier, on Saturday, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, who belongs to the PPP, urged the PM to intervene in order to resolve the differences between the two parties, which have a long history of political confrontation. During his meeting with Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar, the governor had also urged the PML-N led Punjab government to honor its commitment with the PPP, stating that the committee formed by the two parties to resolve issues have yielded no results. Khan said a functional coalition between the PML-N and the PPP would be beneficial for the country, warning that if the coalition government fails, it would primarily harm the PML-N, which currently leads the government. Last week, Bilawal had criticized the PML-N led federal government for failing to honor commitments to the PPP. He alleged that the PML-N government had not consulted with the PPP on policy matters such as the recent crackdown against the Virtual Private Networks (VPNs and restrictions imposed on internet access. He had also expressed concern about the proposed amendments to the IRSA Act to pave the way for construction of more canals on the River Indus.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511742/defiant-pti-marchers-knock-on-capital-door,Defiant PTI marchers knock on capital door,"November 25, 2024","PK Clashes reported from Attock bridge  hundreds arrested The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) embarked on a collision course with the government on Sunday as it finally started marching toward the federal capital after refusing to call off the 'final' protest call given by the imprisoned party founder Imran Khan for his release, among other things. The routes leading to the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi have been closed with containers and heavy contingents of the law-enforcement agencies (LEA) personnel were deployed to meet any eventuality. The PTI rallies from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) led by Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, as well as from different cities of Punjab, began advancing towards the D-Chowk ‚Äì located right in front of the Parliament House in the Red Zone of the federal capital. A large PTI procession from K-P entered Punjab from the Attock bridge, Chach Interchange and Ghazi Barotha Canal. The convoy of vehicles stopped at Ghazi for a while, where Chief Minister Gandapur and Bushra Bibi, wife of Imran Khan, addressed the supporters urging them to move forward. When another convoy, coming from Haripur, reached the Attock Bridge, the police resorted to tear gas shelling. The protesters, meanwhile, set fire to the green belts around them, while a Suzuki van parked at Ghazi Bridge was also torched. A policeman was injured when directly hit by a motorcycle rider. The PTI, after entering Punjab, changed its strategy and directed the convoys coming from the Hazara Division, which had reached Taxila under the leadership of Omar Ayub, to join Gandapur-led convoy. Clashes were also reported from the Isakhel Interchange in Dera Ismail Khan. The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily¬óand denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised. He made it clear that no one would be allowed to disrupt the law and order in the capital, and that the administration, police, and LEAs were prepared to deal with any possible situation. He mentioned that Belarus president's visit was crucial in strengthening relationship between the two countries.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511800/diddy-smiles-and-blows-kisses-to-family-during-court-bail-hearing,Diddy smiles and blows kisses to family during court bail hearing,"November 25, 2024","US Diddy appeared optimistic at a New York City bail hearing as he sought release amid sex trafficking charges. Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs appeared upbeat as he entered a New York City courtroom for a bail hearing, hoping to secure his release while facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. The 55-year-old music mogul greeted his family with blown kisses and waves as he entered South Manhattan Federal Court, wearing a beige prison jumpsuit. Unlike previous hearings, he was not shackled and was escorted by US marshals. Family and supporters, including his mother Janice Combs, daughter Chance Combs, son Justin Dior Combs, and adopted son Quincy Brown, attended the hearing on Friday afternoon. The judge deferred the decision on granting him bail, following arguments from prosecutors that Combs could not be ‚Äútrusted‚Äù to follow conditions and might evade legal supervision even with his lawyers‚Äô guidance. Combs is currently detained on a $50 million bond at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, as he awaits his trial. During the hearing, Combs‚Äô legal team pointed to changed circumstances, including new evidence, as reasons to release him, arguing it would allow him to better prepare for his trial scheduled for May 5. Previously, two judges have ruled that he poses a danger to the community and is a flight risk. Assistant US Attorney Christine Slavik stated that Combs‚Äô attempts to contact witnesses from prison, often through family members, demonstrated that he ‚Äúcannot and will not follow rules‚Äù set by his own legal team. ‚ÄúSimply put, the defendant cannot be trusted,‚Äù she said. Slavik further accused Combs‚Äô lawyers of ‚Äúenabling his flouting of rules‚Äù and argued that they had shown an ‚Äúinability to control their client.‚Äù Last week, prosecutors alleged that Combs used jailmates‚Äô phones to intimidate potential witnesses ahead of his trial. According to court documents, he allegedly contacted family members from prison, asking them to reach out to potential victims and craft ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù while making ‚Äúrelentless efforts‚Äù to ‚Äúcorruptly influence witness testimony.‚Äù COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

IShowSpeed‚Äôs adventurous 2024 streaming tour took a bruising turn in New Zealand when he stepped into the cage with UFC veteran Dan Hooker. Known for his bold personality, the streamer visited City Kickboxing, the renowned gym that has produced MMA superstars like Israel Adesanya and Kai Kara-France, but quickly learned the price of challenging an elite fighter. Walking into the gym with his signature confidence, Speed greeted trainers and up-and-coming athletes, declaring, ‚ÄúNobody in here can beat me at boxing.‚Äù After a brief sparring session with an amateur, which left him momentarily shaken, Speed adjusted the rules to better suit his strengths. However, his bravado was tested further when Dan Hooker, a 10-year UFC veteran with 24 wins, entered the cage. Speed, cautious about the UFC star‚Äôs capabilities, insisted, ‚ÄúNo kicking‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs do boxing.‚Äù What followed was a spectacle of endurance and humility. Speed tried to keep his distance, circling the edges of the octagon, but moments of hesitation allowed Hooker to capitalize. The Hangman dropped the streamer multiple times, laughing as he said, ‚ÄúWelcome to my world, brother.‚Äù When Speed protested about a weight difference, Hooker quipped, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lighter than you,‚Äù highlighting the uphill battle Speed faced. Clips of the match, including one where Speed was left clutching his ribs, quickly went viral, with fans praising his courage and laughing at his antics. After the match, Speed admitted, ‚ÄúHe got me good‚Ä¶ I could tell you were going easy on me.‚Äù Hooker returned the compliment on Instagram, calling Speed ‚Äúballs of steel.‚Äù While his UFC dreams may be out of reach, Speed‚Äôs resilience and charisma hint at a promising future in the influencer boxing realm.

During a recent livestream with popular streamer xQc, Drake raised eyebrows with his comments about Steve Lacy, calling him a ""fragile opp"" while acknowledging his music. As Lacy's tracks played in the background, Drake remarked, ‚ÄúThis guy‚Äôs like a fragile opp, but this is a good song though,‚Äù a statement fans quickly linked to Lacy‚Äôs association with Kendrick Lamar. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration with Lamar on tracks like Not Like Us and his presence at Lamar‚Äôs The Pop Out- Ken & Friends concert earlier this year solidified his alliance with the rapper. Their bond is rooted in shared Compton origins, with Lacy openly expressing pride in his hometown and supporting Lamar during his high-profile feud with Drake. A post shared by Shifting Culture (@shiftingculture) Drake‚Äôs comments come amid a backdrop of tension with Kendrick Lamar, who recently released his surprise album GNX. The album, including tracks like Not Like Us and Euphoria, continued to take shots at Drake. Responding to Kendrick‚Äôs diss tracks during the stream, Drake said, ‚ÄúYou need facts to take me out. Fairytales won‚Äôt do it.‚Äù Fans have taken to social media to dissect the remarks, with some viewing them as a playful jab and others interpreting a deeper rivalry. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration on Kendrick‚Äôs PRIDE and his active support for the rapper further fuel speculation about his role in the ongoing feud between the two musical powerhouses. While Drake remains one of the most dominant artists in hip-hop, his remarks during the xQc stream have reignited discussions about alliances and rivalries in the music industry.

When it comes to dog breeds, some stand out for their strength, loyalty, and protective nature. However, a combination of these traits, especially when not managed properly, can lead to aggressive tendencies. While any dog can become aggressive under certain circumstances, there are certain breeds that, due to their history, physical power, or guarding instincts, are more likely to display aggressive behavior if not properly trained and socialized. Understanding these breeds helps ensure responsible pet ownership and safer interactions. Here, we explore 21 of the most dangerous and aggressive dog breeds, highlighting their tendencies and why they may pose a risk if mishandled.  Originally bred as a fighting dog in Japan, the Tosa Inu is large, strong, and protective, making it prone to aggression without proper socialization and training. Due to its potential for aggression, ownership is legally restricted or banned in several countries including the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.  Known for its powerful build and strong prey drive, the Dogo Argentino is territorial and can become aggressive around strangers or unfamiliar animals. This breed has ownership restrictions in several countries, including Australia, Austria, and the UK.  The Fila Brasileiro is fiercely loyal and protective of its territory. It can be highly aggressive towards strangers, requiring firm control and proper training. In countries such as the UK, Australia, and Hong Kong, ownership is either restricted or illegal without special exemption.  While Bull Terriers are often friendly, they can become stubborn and aggressive if not well-trained and socialized. The breed‚Äôs tenacity can lead to dangerous behavior if mishandled.  This large, muscular breed is known for its protective instincts. While they can be affectionate with their families, they can show aggression toward strangers, especially without proper socialization. Rottweilers tend to be more aggressive toward strangers, according to some studies.  Originally bred as farm guardians, Boerboels are protective and powerful, which can lead to aggressive behavior if not trained and managed carefully. Ownership of this breed is restricted in many countries including Denmark, Romania, and Qatar.  Akitas are strong-willed and independent, often showing aggression toward other dogs and strangers without proper training. In some regions, the breed is classified as a dangerous dog due to its territorial instincts.  While this hunting breed is typically strong and confident, it can become aggressive if not socialized properly. Ridgebacks may not be ideal for inexperienced dog owners or families with young children.  Pitbulls have a history as fighting dogs, and their physical strength can make them dangerous if not properly trained and socialized. Many countries, including the UK and Australia, have breed-specific legislation banning Pitbulls or restricting ownership.  Known for their intelligence and loyalty, German Shepherds can become aggressive if they feel their family is under threat. This breed is frequently used for police and military work due to its protective nature.  Boxers are energetic and strong, but they can exhibit aggression if they are not properly exercised or trained. They require consistent management to prevent undesirable behavior.  The Cane Corso is a large and dominant breed, known for its guarding instincts. Without proper training and discipline, they can display territorial aggression.  Siberian Huskies are friendly but have a strong prey drive. Without sufficient exercise and training, they can become aggressive or unpredictable, especially when interacting with other animals.  Dobermans are known for their guarding instincts and protective nature. Without proper training, they can be aggressive towards strangers or perceived threats.  Bulldogs can be stubborn and may show aggression if improperly socialized or provoked. Though generally friendly, they can become territorial or aggressive if mishandled.  Bullmastiffs are protective by nature and can become aggressive toward intruders or unfamiliar animals. Their size and strength make them a formidable breed if not properly trained.  Chow Chows can be aloof and territorial. Without proper training, they can become aggressive toward strangers or other dogs. Their independence can sometimes make them difficult to manage.  Basenjis are independent and can show aggression if not socialized properly. Known for their intelligence and independence, they require firm training and early socialization to prevent aggressive behavior.  A mix of Mastiffs and Pitbulls, Bandogs are powerful and can show aggression if not trained properly. These dogs require experienced handlers to prevent aggressive behavior from escalating.  Though affectionate with family, Staffordshire Bull Terriers can be aggressive toward other dogs if not socialized properly. Despite being loving, they require firm management to prevent potential issues.  Neapolitan Mastiffs are massive and protective. If they sense a threat, they can become aggressive. These dogs need firm training and should be handled with care to prevent unwanted aggression. While many of these breeds are associated with aggression, it‚Äôs essential to remember that most dogs are loving and gentle when properly trained and cared for. Aggression typically arises from mishandling, improper training, or a lack of socialization. Dogs, regardless of their breed, are often more likely to be protective and loyal than dangerous. Responsible ownership, proper training, and early socialization play a crucial role in ensuring that dogs, regardless of their breed, remain well-behaved and safe members of society.

A group of 12 men who were employed by Mohamed Al Fayed have accused the disgraced former Harrods owner of abusive behavior.

More than 420 women have also accused Fayed of rape or sexual abuse, with their cases being handled by the Justice for Harrods Survivors group.

Many of Fayed‚Äôs crimes were first uncovered in a 1998 unauthorized biography by journalist Tom Bower. However, additional shocking allegations emerged after a BBC documentary revealed that over 20 former Harrods staff accused Fayed of sexual assault, including rape.

Rebel Wilson's attempt to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the producers of her directorial debut,The Deb, has been denied by a Los Angeles Superior Court. Judge Thomas Long ruled that the actress‚Äôs claims of sexual harassment and embezzlement, made in an Instagram video and other contexts, do not qualify as protected free speech under California‚Äôs anti-SLAPP statute. The producers, Amanda Ghost, Gregor Cameron, and Vince Holden, allege that Wilson defamed them to gain creative control and force the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Wilson had previously accused the producers of inappropriate behavior toward the film‚Äôs lead actress and embezzling approximately AU $900,000 from the budget. However, lead actress Charlotte MacInnes denied these allegations, stating in court that Wilson‚Äôs claims were baseless and made her feel bullied by the director. While Wilson countersued in October, alleging theft, bullying, and harassment by the producers, her legal team plans to appeal the recent ruling. Camille Vasquez, attorney for the producers, commended the court‚Äôs decision, calling Wilson‚Äôs dismissal motion a ‚Äúcynical attempt‚Äù to suppress valid legal claims.

Jon Watts has revealed he scrapped plans for a sequel to Wolfs, starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, citing a loss of trust in Apple. The director explained that the studio‚Äôs last-minute decision to shift the original film from a wide theatrical release to a limited run followed by streaming led to his decision. Watts shared with Deadline that Apple initially praised his final cut of Wolfs and even commissioned a sequel. However, he was blindsided by the pivot to streaming, learning of the change less than a week before the public announcement. ‚ÄúApple didn‚Äôt cancel the sequel‚ÄîI did‚Äîbecause I no longer trusted them as a creative partner,‚Äù Watts stated. Despite his disappointment, he returned the sequel commission to avoid generating negative press during the film‚Äôs release.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511799/pti-convoys-face-tear-gas-as-march-towards-islamabad-continues,PTI convoys face tear gas as march towards Islamabad continues,"November 25, 2024","US PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar says talks are underway. PTI convoys led by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Opposition leader, Omar Ayub, entered Punjab premises on the call of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan. The convoys, originating from the Hazara Interchange, are heading towards D-Chowk in Islamabad. As the convoys advanced, they encountered heavy resistance from the police at the Ghazi Brotha Bridge, where intense shelling was reported. Despite the police crackdown, Omar Ayub's convoy managed to push back Punjab Police forces at the Hazara Interchange. Ali Amin Gandapur, who is leading the Hazara Division convoy, played a crucial role in helping the convoy break through the police barricades. After overcoming the police blockade, the convoys continued their journey, with vehicles stretching over two kilometers as they moved forward. On the Hazara Motorway, PTI supporters successfully forced police to retreat, with reports of violent clashes and heavy stone-pelting. Several police personnel were injured in the scuffles, and two officers were severely wounded and transferred to hospitals. Among the injured officers were DSPs Chaudhry Zulfiqar and Shahid Gilani, as well as ASI Tabassum. DSP Zulfiqar suffered significant injuries to his back and legs during the confrontation. 'Talks underway' Barrister Gohar Khan and Saif held a 90-minute meeting with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi. Following the meeting, Barrister Gohar described the discussion as significant, confirming that Imran Khan‚Äôs call for a protest remains final and that rumors about it being canceled were untrue. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Barrister Gohar emphasised that the PTI founder‚Äôs stance on the protest was unchanged, and the movement would proceed as planned. The meeting focused on strategic discussions regarding the ongoing political situation and the party's future course of action. When asked about the ongoing negotiations surrounding the protest, Barrister Gohar assured reporters that updates would be provided in due course. He further confirmed that discussions were still ongoing but did not offer further details at this time. 'Final call' The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. Internet services suspension The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily and denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. Several leaders arrested A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised.

Rebel Wilson's attempt to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the producers of her directorial debut,The Deb, has been denied by a Los Angeles Superior Court. Judge Thomas Long ruled that the actress‚Äôs claims of sexual harassment and embezzlement, made in an Instagram video and other contexts, do not qualify as protected free speech under California‚Äôs anti-SLAPP statute. The producers, Amanda Ghost, Gregor Cameron, and Vince Holden, allege that Wilson defamed them to gain creative control and force the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Wilson had previously accused the producers of inappropriate behavior toward the film‚Äôs lead actress and embezzling approximately AU $900,000 from the budget. However, lead actress Charlotte MacInnes denied these allegations, stating in court that Wilson‚Äôs claims were baseless and made her feel bullied by the director. While Wilson countersued in October, alleging theft, bullying, and harassment by the producers, her legal team plans to appeal the recent ruling. Camille Vasquez, attorney for the producers, commended the court‚Äôs decision, calling Wilson‚Äôs dismissal motion a ‚Äúcynical attempt‚Äù to suppress valid legal claims.

Jon Watts has revealed he scrapped plans for a sequel to Wolfs, starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, citing a loss of trust in Apple. The director explained that the studio‚Äôs last-minute decision to shift the original film from a wide theatrical release to a limited run followed by streaming led to his decision. Watts shared with Deadline that Apple initially praised his final cut of Wolfs and even commissioned a sequel. However, he was blindsided by the pivot to streaming, learning of the change less than a week before the public announcement. ‚ÄúApple didn‚Äôt cancel the sequel‚ÄîI did‚Äîbecause I no longer trusted them as a creative partner,‚Äù Watts stated. Despite his disappointment, he returned the sequel commission to avoid generating negative press during the film‚Äôs release. Watts also expressed frustration with Apple for ignoring his request to exclude the sequel announcement from their press release. ‚ÄúThey used it to create a positive spin on their streaming decision,‚Äù he said, emphasizing that the move came without explanation or discussion. While proud of Wolfs, Watts felt compelled to take a stand for creative transparency.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511809/everything-is-magical-in-wicked-even-the-fashion,"Everything is Magical in 'Wicked', Even the Fashion!",Date not found,"Costume designer Paul Tazewell weaved his magic for ‚ÄòWicked,‚Äô here's how he breathed life into the costume design. When it comes to the world ofWicked, the costumes are just as magical as the story itself. Costume designer Paul Tazewell, known for his meticulous attention to detail, has crafted costumes that not only define the characters of Elphaba and Glinda but also contribute to the world-building of Oz. His journey into the world ofWickedwas shaped by a French picture book, which inspired him to create a visual world where every scene is as captivating as the last, down to the smallest details. Tazewell‚Äôs designs breathe life into the characters, giving depth and backstory through the clothes they wear.  Tracy Nguyen for The New York Times Elphaba‚Äôs earth-toned, textured wardrobe and Glinda‚Äôs glamorous, show-stopping dresses aren‚Äôt just about fabric‚Äîthey‚Äôre about storytelling. From the iconic pink bubble dress, a design requiring 137 pattern pieces and over 200 hours of hand-beading, to the intricately felted details of Elphaba's costume, every stitch is a part of a bigger narrative. Paul Tazewell brings more than three decades of experience in costume design, with accolades ranging from Broadway hits likeHamiltonandIn the Heightsto his film work onHarrietandWest Side Story. But it was his approach toWickedthat allowed him to blend his deep love of detail with a fresh, modern interpretation.  Paul Tazewell has spent more than 30 years designing costumes for theater. Image: Instyle Tazewell wanted the costumes to speak to a more expansive, reimagined version of the world of Oz, one that still felt grounded in its theatrical history but also distinctly his own. His meticulous work not only pays homage to the original Broadway costumes designed by Susan Hilferty but also reinterprets them to suit the needs of the film, ensuring the costumes fit perfectly into the cinematic version of this beloved tale. His work with the color palettes of Elphaba‚Äôs darker, nature-inspired wardrobe and Glinda‚Äôs lighter, airy look shows the evolution of their characters and their relationship. As Elphaba begins to find herself and grow more comfortable with her own power, her clothes shift from restrictive, turn-of-the-century shapes to more modern, freeing silhouettes.  Cynthia Erivo's costumes as Elphaba featured textural elements that were inspired by nature. Image: Universal Glinda‚Äôs journey also plays out through her fashion‚Äîher early, overly feminine looks evolve as her bond with Elphaba deepens, resulting in a blending of both characters' visual identities.  The bodice of Glinda's (played by Ariana Grande) bubble gown took 225 hours to hand-bead. Image: Universal Tazewell‚Äôs passion for detail extends beyond just the characters. The costumes, made by an extensive team of artisans, serve as an immersive experience that captures every nuance ofWicked's world. With over 60 costumes per lead character and a total of 140 crew members working across eight different workshops, Tazewell's vision comes to life in ways that are both stunning and intricate. His ability to weave the characters' emotional arcs into their clothing and his understanding of how the designs would resonate with the audience is what makes his work so remarkable.  The costumes for Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) featured magical iconography. Image: Universal The film‚Äôs approach toWickedisn‚Äôt about just re-creating past designs; it‚Äôs about evolving them into something new while retaining the magic that has made the characters so iconic. The challenge of blending the theatrical elements with the expansive world of film is one Tazewell embraces with confidence, bringing his creative vision to the forefront in a way that enhances the storytelling. Ultimately, Tazewell's work onWickedis about more than just creating beautiful costumes‚Äîit's about ensuring that every detail, from fabric to silhouette, adds to the narrative, bringing each character‚Äôs journey to life in the most magical way possible. The world of Oz feels alive through Tazewell‚Äôs designs, and it's a testament to his incredible talent and vision that every element ofWicked's costumes adds depth to the story. The world ofWickedfeels vast and boundless. The teamwork between Tazewell, Chu, Crowley, and everyone involved has brought to life something incredibly detailed, imaginative, rich, and exciting‚Äîso much so that you‚Äôll wish it could slow down, allowing you to fully appreciate every intricate detail, from the background characters to Jonathan Bailey‚Äôs Fiyero boots.

Held at Auditorium Shores in Town Lake, the contest drew dozens of Powell‚Äôs lookalikes, but the actor couldn‚Äôt attend in person due to filming commitments in England for The Running Man. Despite his absence, Powell made his presence felt through a Facetime appearance, where he delivered a humorous video message packed with jokes and playful remarks. In his lighthearted video, Powell quipped that the contest was actually for This Is Us actor Justin Hartley‚Äôs lookalike and teased attendees about forming a ‚Äúcriminal Glen-Terprise‚Äù heist. ‚ÄúAnd we don‚Äôt need masks because we all have the same face: It‚Äôs the perfect crime,‚Äù he joked.

While the two were in the kitchen, SZA commented that Cenat seemed like a ""clean person."" Lizzo agreed but quickly joked that Cenat hadn't ""washed his balls"" in a long time.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511800/diddy-smiles-and-blows-kisses-to-family-during-court-bail-hearing,Diddy smiles and blows kisses to family during court bail hearing,"November 25, 2024","US Diddy appeared optimistic at a New York City bail hearing as he sought release amid sex trafficking charges. Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs appeared upbeat as he entered a New York City courtroom for a bail hearing, hoping to secure his release while facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. The 55-year-old music mogul greeted his family with blown kisses and waves as he entered South Manhattan Federal Court, wearing a beige prison jumpsuit. Unlike previous hearings, he was not shackled and was escorted by US marshals. Family and supporters, including his mother Janice Combs, daughter Chance Combs, son Justin Dior Combs, and adopted son Quincy Brown, attended the hearing on Friday afternoon. The judge deferred the decision on granting him bail, following arguments from prosecutors that Combs could not be ‚Äútrusted‚Äù to follow conditions and might evade legal supervision even with his lawyers‚Äô guidance. Combs is currently detained on a $50 million bond at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, as he awaits his trial. During the hearing, Combs‚Äô legal team pointed to changed circumstances, including new evidence, as reasons to release him, arguing it would allow him to better prepare for his trial scheduled for May 5. Previously, two judges have ruled that he poses a danger to the community and is a flight risk. Assistant US Attorney Christine Slavik stated that Combs‚Äô attempts to contact witnesses from prison, often through family members, demonstrated that he ‚Äúcannot and will not follow rules‚Äù set by his own legal team. ‚ÄúSimply put, the defendant cannot be trusted,‚Äù she said. Slavik further accused Combs‚Äô lawyers of ‚Äúenabling his flouting of rules‚Äù and argued that they had shown an ‚Äúinability to control their client.‚Äù Last week, prosecutors alleged that Combs used jailmates‚Äô phones to intimidate potential witnesses ahead of his trial. According to court documents, he allegedly contacted family members from prison, asking them to reach out to potential victims and craft ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù while making ‚Äúrelentless efforts‚Äù to ‚Äúcorruptly influence witness testimony.‚Äù COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511799/pti-convoys-face-tear-gas-as-march-towards-islamabad-continues,PTI convoys face tear gas as march towards Islamabad continues,"November 25, 2024","US PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar says talks are underway. PTI convoys led by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Opposition leader, Omar Ayub, entered Punjab premises on the call of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan. The convoys, originating from the Hazara Interchange, are heading towards D-Chowk in Islamabad. As the convoys advanced, they encountered heavy resistance from the police at the Ghazi Brotha Bridge, where intense shelling was reported. Despite the police crackdown, Omar Ayub's convoy managed to push back Punjab Police forces at the Hazara Interchange. Ali Amin Gandapur, who is leading the Hazara Division convoy, played a crucial role in helping the convoy break through the police barricades. After overcoming the police blockade, the convoys continued their journey, with vehicles stretching over two kilometers as they moved forward. On the Hazara Motorway, PTI supporters successfully forced police to retreat, with reports of violent clashes and heavy stone-pelting. Several police personnel were injured in the scuffles, and two officers were severely wounded and transferred to hospitals. Among the injured officers were DSPs Chaudhry Zulfiqar and Shahid Gilani, as well as ASI Tabassum. DSP Zulfiqar suffered significant injuries to his back and legs during the confrontation. 'Talks underway' Barrister Gohar Khan and Saif held a 90-minute meeting with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi. Following the meeting, Barrister Gohar described the discussion as significant, confirming that Imran Khan‚Äôs call for a protest remains final and that rumors about it being canceled were untrue. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Barrister Gohar emphasised that the PTI founder‚Äôs stance on the protest was unchanged, and the movement would proceed as planned. The meeting focused on strategic discussions regarding the ongoing political situation and the party's future course of action. When asked about the ongoing negotiations surrounding the protest, Barrister Gohar assured reporters that updates would be provided in due course. He further confirmed that discussions were still ongoing but did not offer further details at this time. 'Final call' The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. Internet services suspension The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily and denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. Several leaders arrested A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised.

IShowSpeed‚Äôs adventurous 2024 streaming tour took a bruising turn in New Zealand when he stepped into the cage with UFC veteran Dan Hooker. Known for his bold personality, the streamer visited City Kickboxing, the renowned gym that has produced MMA superstars like Israel Adesanya and Kai Kara-France, but quickly learned the price of challenging an elite fighter. Walking into the gym with his signature confidence, Speed greeted trainers and up-and-coming athletes, declaring, ‚ÄúNobody in here can beat me at boxing.‚Äù After a brief sparring session with an amateur, which left him momentarily shaken, Speed adjusted the rules to better suit his strengths. However, his bravado was tested further when Dan Hooker, a 10-year UFC veteran with 24 wins, entered the cage. Speed, cautious about the UFC star‚Äôs capabilities, insisted, ‚ÄúNo kicking‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs do boxing.‚Äù What followed was a spectacle of endurance and humility. Speed tried to keep his distance, circling the edges of the octagon, but moments of hesitation allowed Hooker to capitalize. The Hangman dropped the streamer multiple times, laughing as he said, ‚ÄúWelcome to my world, brother.‚Äù When Speed protested about a weight difference, Hooker quipped, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lighter than you,‚Äù highlighting the uphill battle Speed faced. Clips of the match, including one where Speed was left clutching his ribs, quickly went viral, with fans praising his courage and laughing at his antics. After the match, Speed admitted, ‚ÄúHe got me good‚Ä¶ I could tell you were going easy on me.‚Äù Hooker returned the compliment on Instagram, calling Speed ‚Äúballs of steel.‚Äù While his UFC dreams may be out of reach, Speed‚Äôs resilience and charisma hint at a promising future in the influencer boxing realm.

During a recent livestream with popular streamer xQc, Drake raised eyebrows with his comments about Steve Lacy, calling him a ""fragile opp"" while acknowledging his music. As Lacy's tracks played in the background, Drake remarked, ‚ÄúThis guy‚Äôs like a fragile opp, but this is a good song though,‚Äù a statement fans quickly linked to Lacy‚Äôs association with Kendrick Lamar. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration with Lamar on tracks like Not Like Us and his presence at Lamar‚Äôs The Pop Out- Ken & Friends concert earlier this year solidified his alliance with the rapper. Their bond is rooted in shared Compton origins, with Lacy openly expressing pride in his hometown and supporting Lamar during his high-profile feud with Drake. A post shared by Shifting Culture (@shiftingculture) Drake‚Äôs comments come amid a backdrop of tension with Kendrick Lamar, who recently released his surprise album GNX. The album, including tracks like Not Like Us and Euphoria, continued to take shots at Drake. Responding to Kendrick‚Äôs diss tracks during the stream, Drake said, ‚ÄúYou need facts to take me out. Fairytales won‚Äôt do it.‚Äù Fans have taken to social media to dissect the remarks, with some viewing them as a playful jab and others interpreting a deeper rivalry. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration on Kendrick‚Äôs PRIDE and his active support for the rapper further fuel speculation about his role in the ongoing feud between the two musical powerhouses. While Drake remains one of the most dominant artists in hip-hop, his remarks during the xQc stream have reignited discussions about alliances and rivalries in the music industry.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511795/21-dangerous-and-aggressive-dog-breeds-you-should-know-about,21 Dangerous and Aggressive Dog Breeds You Should Know About,Date not found,"Some dog breeds are known for their power and potential danger if mishandled‚Äîhere are 21 to be aware of. When it comes to dog breeds, some stand out for their strength, loyalty, and protective nature. However, a combination of these traits, especially when not managed properly, can lead to aggressive tendencies. While any dog can become aggressive under certain circumstances, there are certain breeds that, due to their history, physical power, or guarding instincts, are more likely to display aggressive behavior if not properly trained and socialized. Understanding these breeds helps ensure responsible pet ownership and safer interactions. Here, we explore 21 of the most dangerous and aggressive dog breeds, highlighting their tendencies and why they may pose a risk if mishandled.  Originally bred as a fighting dog in Japan, the Tosa Inu is large, strong, and protective, making it prone to aggression without proper socialization and training. Due to its potential for aggression, ownership is legally restricted or banned in several countries including the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.  Known for its powerful build and strong prey drive, the Dogo Argentino is territorial and can become aggressive around strangers or unfamiliar animals. This breed has ownership restrictions in several countries, including Australia, Austria, and the UK.  The Fila Brasileiro is fiercely loyal and protective of its territory. It can be highly aggressive towards strangers, requiring firm control and proper training. In countries such as the UK, Australia, and Hong Kong, ownership is either restricted or illegal without special exemption.  While Bull Terriers are often friendly, they can become stubborn and aggressive if not well-trained and socialized. The breed‚Äôs tenacity can lead to dangerous behavior if mishandled.  This large, muscular breed is known for its protective instincts. While they can be affectionate with their families, they can show aggression toward strangers, especially without proper socialization. Rottweilers tend to be more aggressive toward strangers, according to some studies.  Originally bred as farm guardians, Boerboels are protective and powerful, which can lead to aggressive behavior if not trained and managed carefully. Ownership of this breed is restricted in many countries including Denmark, Romania, and Qatar.  Akitas are strong-willed and independent, often showing aggression toward other dogs and strangers without proper training. In some regions, the breed is classified as a dangerous dog due to its territorial instincts.  While this hunting breed is typically strong and confident, it can become aggressive if not socialized properly. Ridgebacks may not be ideal for inexperienced dog owners or families with young children.  Pitbulls have a history as fighting dogs, and their physical strength can make them dangerous if not properly trained and socialized. Many countries, including the UK and Australia, have breed-specific legislation banning Pitbulls or restricting ownership.  Known for their intelligence and loyalty, German Shepherds can become aggressive if they feel their family is under threat. This breed is frequently used for police and military work due to its protective nature.  Boxers are energetic and strong, but they can exhibit aggression if they are not properly exercised or trained. They require consistent management to prevent undesirable behavior.  The Cane Corso is a large and dominant breed, known for its guarding instincts. Without proper training and discipline, they can display territorial aggression.  Siberian Huskies are friendly but have a strong prey drive. Without sufficient exercise and training, they can become aggressive or unpredictable, especially when interacting with other animals.  Dobermans are known for their guarding instincts and protective nature. Without proper training, they can be aggressive towards strangers or perceived threats.  Bulldogs can be stubborn and may show aggression if improperly socialized or provoked. Though generally friendly, they can become territorial or aggressive if mishandled.  Bullmastiffs are protective by nature and can become aggressive toward intruders or unfamiliar animals. Their size and strength make them a formidable breed if not properly trained.  Chow Chows can be aloof and territorial. Without proper training, they can become aggressive toward strangers or other dogs. Their independence can sometimes make them difficult to manage.  Basenjis are independent and can show aggression if not socialized properly. Known for their intelligence and independence, they require firm training and early socialization to prevent aggressive behavior.  A mix of Mastiffs and Pitbulls, Bandogs are powerful and can show aggression if not trained properly. These dogs require experienced handlers to prevent aggressive behavior from escalating.  Though affectionate with family, Staffordshire Bull Terriers can be aggressive toward other dogs if not socialized properly. Despite being loving, they require firm management to prevent potential issues.  Neapolitan Mastiffs are massive and protective. If they sense a threat, they can become aggressive. These dogs need firm training and should be handled with care to prevent unwanted aggression. While many of these breeds are associated with aggression, it‚Äôs essential to remember that most dogs are loving and gentle when properly trained and cared for. Aggression typically arises from mishandling, improper training, or a lack of socialization. Dogs, regardless of their breed, are often more likely to be protective and loyal than dangerous. Responsible ownership, proper training, and early socialization play a crucial role in ensuring that dogs, regardless of their breed, remain well-behaved and safe members of society.

I wish I had $200-$300K."" Lindsay Lohan, 38, has been making waves with her radiant and youthful appearance, sparking speculation about a major transformation. Aesthetics expert Dr. Jonny Betteridge claims the star may have spent up to $300,000 on various cosmetic procedures to achieve her stunning new look. Dr. Betteridge, founder of JB Aesthetics in London, shared his analysis in an Instagram video, listing potential enhancements including a facelift, upper eyelid surgery, a nose job, and a surgical brow lift. ‚ÄúShe most likely had some degree of surgical facelift done via an endoscopic approach, meaning it was minimally invasive,‚Äù he explained. Additional treatments allegedly include botox, lip fillers, a lip lift, and veneers, paired with laser resurfacing and a dermatologist-led skincare routine.

Dr. Betteridge, founder of JB Aesthetics in London, shared his analysis in an Instagram video, listing potential enhancements including a facelift, upper eyelid surgery, a nose job, and a surgical brow lift. ‚ÄúShe most likely had some degree of surgical facelift done via an endoscopic approach, meaning it was minimally invasive,‚Äù he explained. Additional treatments allegedly include botox, lip fillers, a lip lift, and veneers, paired with laser resurfacing and a dermatologist-led skincare routine. Fans were quick to praise her transformation on social media. ‚ÄúShe looks amazing. I wish I had $200-$300K,‚Äù one user commented, while another said, ‚ÄúIncredible work! She looks fantastic.‚Äù A post shared by Dr Jonny Betteridge (@drjb.aesthetics) Lohan has attributed her refreshed glow to skincare. In an interview with Allure, the actress revealed her low-maintenance routine, including Av√®ne moisturizers, Peter Thomas Roth eye patches, and occasional laser treatments. ‚ÄúI just want to look at myself and love myself for who I am,‚Äù she shared.

When it comes to the world ofWicked, the costumes are just as magical as the story itself. Costume designer Paul Tazewell, known for his meticulous attention to detail, has crafted costumes that not only define the characters of Elphaba and Glinda but also contribute to the world-building of Oz. His journey into the world ofWickedwas shaped by a French picture book, which inspired him to create a visual world where every scene is as captivating as the last, down to the smallest details. Tazewell‚Äôs designs breathe life into the characters, giving depth and backstory through the clothes they wear.  Tracy Nguyen for The New York Times Elphaba‚Äôs earth-toned, textured wardrobe and Glinda‚Äôs glamorous, show-stopping dresses aren‚Äôt just about fabric‚Äîthey‚Äôre about storytelling. From the iconic pink bubble dress, a design requiring 137 pattern pieces and over 200 hours of hand-beading, to the intricately felted details of Elphaba's costume, every stitch is a part of a bigger narrative. Paul Tazewell brings more than three decades of experience in costume design, with accolades ranging from Broadway hits likeHamiltonandIn the Heightsto his film work onHarrietandWest Side Story. But it was his approach toWickedthat allowed him to blend his deep love of detail with a fresh, modern interpretation.  Paul Tazewell has spent more than 30 years designing costumes for theater. Image: Instyle Tazewell wanted the costumes to speak to a more expansive, reimagined version of the world of Oz, one that still felt grounded in its theatrical history but also distinctly his own. His meticulous work not only pays homage to the original Broadway costumes designed by Susan Hilferty but also reinterprets them to suit the needs of the film, ensuring the costumes fit perfectly into the cinematic version of this beloved tale. His work with the color palettes of Elphaba‚Äôs darker, nature-inspired wardrobe and Glinda‚Äôs lighter, airy look shows the evolution of their characters and their relationship. As Elphaba begins to find herself and grow more comfortable with her own power, her clothes shift from restrictive, turn-of-the-century shapes to more modern, freeing silhouettes.  Cynthia Erivo's costumes as Elphaba featured textural elements that were inspired by nature. Image: Universal Glinda‚Äôs journey also plays out through her fashion‚Äîher early, overly feminine looks evolve as her bond with Elphaba deepens, resulting in a blending of both characters' visual identities.  The bodice of Glinda's (played by Ariana Grande) bubble gown took 225 hours to hand-bead. Image: Universal Tazewell‚Äôs passion for detail extends beyond just the characters. The costumes, made by an extensive team of artisans, serve as an immersive experience that captures every nuance ofWicked's world. With over 60 costumes per lead character and a total of 140 crew members working across eight different workshops, Tazewell's vision comes to life in ways that are both stunning and intricate. His ability to weave the characters' emotional arcs into their clothing and his understanding of how the designs would resonate with the audience is what makes his work so remarkable.  The costumes for Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) featured magical iconography. Image: Universal The film‚Äôs approach toWickedisn‚Äôt about just re-creating past designs; it‚Äôs about evolving them into something new while retaining the magic that has made the characters so iconic. The challenge of blending the theatrical elements with the expansive world of film is one Tazewell embraces with confidence, bringing his creative vision to the forefront in a way that enhances the storytelling. Ultimately, Tazewell's work onWickedis about more than just creating beautiful costumes‚Äîit's about ensuring that every detail, from fabric to silhouette, adds to the narrative, bringing each character‚Äôs journey to life in the most magical way possible. The world of Oz feels alive through Tazewell‚Äôs designs, and it's a testament to his incredible talent and vision that every element ofWicked's costumes adds depth to the story.

Rebel Wilson's attempt to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the producers of her directorial debut,The Deb, has been denied by a Los Angeles Superior Court. Judge Thomas Long ruled that the actress‚Äôs claims of sexual harassment and embezzlement, made in an Instagram video and other contexts, do not qualify as protected free speech under California‚Äôs anti-SLAPP statute. The producers, Amanda Ghost, Gregor Cameron, and Vince Holden, allege that Wilson defamed them to gain creative control and force the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Wilson had previously accused the producers of inappropriate behavior toward the film‚Äôs lead actress and embezzling approximately AU $900,000 from the budget. However, lead actress Charlotte MacInnes denied these allegations, stating in court that Wilson‚Äôs claims were baseless and made her feel bullied by the director. While Wilson countersued in October, alleging theft, bullying, and harassment by the producers, her legal team plans to appeal the recent ruling. Camille Vasquez, attorney for the producers, commended the court‚Äôs decision, calling Wilson‚Äôs dismissal motion a ‚Äúcynical attempt‚Äù to suppress valid legal claims.

Jon Watts has revealed he scrapped plans for a sequel to Wolfs, starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, citing a loss of trust in Apple. The director explained that the studio‚Äôs last-minute decision to shift the original film from a wide theatrical release to a limited run followed by streaming led to his decision. Watts shared with Deadline that Apple initially praised his final cut of Wolfs and even commissioned a sequel. However, he was blindsided by the pivot to streaming, learning of the change less than a week before the public announcement. ‚ÄúApple didn‚Äôt cancel the sequel‚ÄîI did‚Äîbecause I no longer trusted them as a creative partner,‚Äù Watts stated. Despite his disappointment, he returned the sequel commission to avoid generating negative press during the film‚Äôs release. Watts also expressed frustration with Apple for ignoring his request to exclude the sequel announcement from their press release. ‚ÄúThey used it to create a positive spin on their streaming decision,‚Äù he said, emphasizing that the move came without explanation or discussion. While proud of Wolfs, Watts felt compelled to take a stand for creative transparency. His experience echoes a growing trend in the industry, exemplified by Doug Liman‚Äôs Road House debacle after Amazon acquired MGM. Liman, who had anticipated a theatrical release, saw the project shifted to streaming, which directly affected compensation for him and his team. ‚ÄúWe need streaming, but agreements must be honored,‚Äù Liman said in an interview. While Watts supports streaming as a medium, his experience highlights tensions between creative expectations and shifting studio priorities. Apple has yet to comment on the matter, but Watts‚Äô principled decision underscores the importance of trust in creative partnerships.

The winner didn‚Äôt just receive bragging rights but was promised a cameo for their parent or family member in Powell‚Äôs upcoming film‚Äîa prize as unique as the event. Held at Auditorium Shores in Town Lake, the contest drew dozens of Powell‚Äôs lookalikes, but the actor couldn‚Äôt attend in person due to filming commitments in England for The Running Man. Despite his absence, Powell made his presence felt through a Facetime appearance, where he delivered a humorous video message packed with jokes and playful remarks. In his lighthearted video, Powell quipped that the contest was actually for This Is Us actor Justin Hartley‚Äôs lookalike and teased attendees about forming a ‚Äúcriminal Glen-Terprise‚Äù heist. ‚ÄúAnd we don‚Äôt need masks because we all have the same face: It‚Äôs the perfect crime,‚Äù he joked. He also challenged participants to fully commit to the bit, saying, ‚ÄúIf no one is shirtless for no reason, then this whole thing is a sham.‚Äù While his mother and aunt assisted in judging the contest, Powell ensured the highlight was his promise to the winner. He cheekily valued the prize at ‚Äú$6 billion,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúThe winner‚Äôs parent or family member will have a cameo in my next movie.‚Äù Celebrity lookalike contests have grown in popularity, with similar events held for stars like Timoth√©e Chalamet and Harry Styles. However, Powell‚Äôs mix of humor and a quirky, heartfelt prize sets his event apart, showcasing his creative approach to engaging with fans‚Äîeven from thousands of miles away.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511800/diddy-smiles-and-blows-kisses-to-family-during-court-bail-hearing,Diddy smiles and blows kisses to family during court bail hearing,"November 25, 2024","US Diddy appeared optimistic at a New York City bail hearing as he sought release amid sex trafficking charges. Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs appeared upbeat as he entered a New York City courtroom for a bail hearing, hoping to secure his release while facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. The 55-year-old music mogul greeted his family with blown kisses and waves as he entered South Manhattan Federal Court, wearing a beige prison jumpsuit. Unlike previous hearings, he was not shackled and was escorted by US marshals. Family and supporters, including his mother Janice Combs, daughter Chance Combs, son Justin Dior Combs, and adopted son Quincy Brown, attended the hearing on Friday afternoon. The judge deferred the decision on granting him bail, following arguments from prosecutors that Combs could not be ‚Äútrusted‚Äù to follow conditions and might evade legal supervision even with his lawyers‚Äô guidance. Combs is currently detained on a $50 million bond at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, as he awaits his trial. During the hearing, Combs‚Äô legal team pointed to changed circumstances, including new evidence, as reasons to release him, arguing it would allow him to better prepare for his trial scheduled for May 5. Previously, two judges have ruled that he poses a danger to the community and is a flight risk. Assistant US Attorney Christine Slavik stated that Combs‚Äô attempts to contact witnesses from prison, often through family members, demonstrated that he ‚Äúcannot and will not follow rules‚Äù set by his own legal team. ‚ÄúSimply put, the defendant cannot be trusted,‚Äù she said. Slavik further accused Combs‚Äô lawyers of ‚Äúenabling his flouting of rules‚Äù and argued that they had shown an ‚Äúinability to control their client.‚Äù Last week, prosecutors alleged that Combs used jailmates‚Äô phones to intimidate potential witnesses ahead of his trial. According to court documents, he allegedly contacted family members from prison, asking them to reach out to potential victims and craft ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù while making ‚Äúrelentless efforts‚Äù to ‚Äúcorruptly influence witness testimony.‚Äù COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511799/pti-convoys-face-tear-gas-as-march-towards-islamabad-continues,PTI convoys face tear gas as march towards Islamabad continues,"November 25, 2024","US PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar says talks are underway. PTI convoys led by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Opposition leader, Omar Ayub, entered Punjab premises on the call of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan. The convoys, originating from the Hazara Interchange, are heading towards D-Chowk in Islamabad. As the convoys advanced, they encountered heavy resistance from the police at the Ghazi Brotha Bridge, where intense shelling was reported. Despite the police crackdown, Omar Ayub's convoy managed to push back Punjab Police forces at the Hazara Interchange. Ali Amin Gandapur, who is leading the Hazara Division convoy, played a crucial role in helping the convoy break through the police barricades. After overcoming the police blockade, the convoys continued their journey, with vehicles stretching over two kilometers as they moved forward. On the Hazara Motorway, PTI supporters successfully forced police to retreat, with reports of violent clashes and heavy stone-pelting. Several police personnel were injured in the scuffles, and two officers were severely wounded and transferred to hospitals. Among the injured officers were DSPs Chaudhry Zulfiqar and Shahid Gilani, as well as ASI Tabassum. DSP Zulfiqar suffered significant injuries to his back and legs during the confrontation. 'Talks underway' Barrister Gohar Khan and Saif held a 90-minute meeting with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi. Following the meeting, Barrister Gohar described the discussion as significant, confirming that Imran Khan‚Äôs call for a protest remains final and that rumors about it being canceled were untrue. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Barrister Gohar emphasised that the PTI founder‚Äôs stance on the protest was unchanged, and the movement would proceed as planned. The meeting focused on strategic discussions regarding the ongoing political situation and the party's future course of action. When asked about the ongoing negotiations surrounding the protest, Barrister Gohar assured reporters that updates would be provided in due course. He further confirmed that discussions were still ongoing but did not offer further details at this time. 'Final call' The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. Internet services suspension The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily and denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. Several leaders arrested A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised.

IShowSpeed‚Äôs adventurous 2024 streaming tour took a bruising turn in New Zealand when he stepped into the cage with UFC veteran Dan Hooker. Known for his bold personality, the streamer visited City Kickboxing, the renowned gym that has produced MMA superstars like Israel Adesanya and Kai Kara-France, but quickly learned the price of challenging an elite fighter. Walking into the gym with his signature confidence, Speed greeted trainers and up-and-coming athletes, declaring, ‚ÄúNobody in here can beat me at boxing.‚Äù After a brief sparring session with an amateur, which left him momentarily shaken, Speed adjusted the rules to better suit his strengths. However, his bravado was tested further when Dan Hooker, a 10-year UFC veteran with 24 wins, entered the cage. Speed, cautious about the UFC star‚Äôs capabilities, insisted, ‚ÄúNo kicking‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs do boxing.‚Äù What followed was a spectacle of endurance and humility. Speed tried to keep his distance, circling the edges of the octagon, but moments of hesitation allowed Hooker to capitalize. The Hangman dropped the streamer multiple times, laughing as he said, ‚ÄúWelcome to my world, brother.‚Äù When Speed protested about a weight difference, Hooker quipped, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lighter than you,‚Äù highlighting the uphill battle Speed faced. Clips of the match, including one where Speed was left clutching his ribs, quickly went viral, with fans praising his courage and laughing at his antics. After the match, Speed admitted, ‚ÄúHe got me good‚Ä¶ I could tell you were going easy on me.‚Äù Hooker returned the compliment on Instagram, calling Speed ‚Äúballs of steel.‚Äù While his UFC dreams may be out of reach, Speed‚Äôs resilience and charisma hint at a promising future in the influencer boxing realm.

During a recent livestream with popular streamer xQc, Drake raised eyebrows with his comments about Steve Lacy, calling him a ""fragile opp"" while acknowledging his music. As Lacy's tracks played in the background, Drake remarked, ‚ÄúThis guy‚Äôs like a fragile opp, but this is a good song though,‚Äù a statement fans quickly linked to Lacy‚Äôs association with Kendrick Lamar. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration with Lamar on tracks like Not Like Us and his presence at Lamar‚Äôs The Pop Out- Ken & Friends concert earlier this year solidified his alliance with the rapper. Their bond is rooted in shared Compton origins, with Lacy openly expressing pride in his hometown and supporting Lamar during his high-profile feud with Drake. A post shared by Shifting Culture (@shiftingculture) Drake‚Äôs comments come amid a backdrop of tension with Kendrick Lamar, who recently released his surprise album GNX. The album, including tracks like Not Like Us and Euphoria, continued to take shots at Drake. Responding to Kendrick‚Äôs diss tracks during the stream, Drake said, ‚ÄúYou need facts to take me out. Fairytales won‚Äôt do it.‚Äù Fans have taken to social media to dissect the remarks, with some viewing them as a playful jab and others interpreting a deeper rivalry. Steve Lacy‚Äôs collaboration on Kendrick‚Äôs PRIDE and his active support for the rapper further fuel speculation about his role in the ongoing feud between the two musical powerhouses. While Drake remains one of the most dominant artists in hip-hop, his remarks during the xQc stream have reignited discussions about alliances and rivalries in the music industry.

I wish I had $200-$300K."" Lindsay Lohan, 38, has been making waves with her radiant and youthful appearance, sparking speculation about a major transformation. Aesthetics expert Dr. Jonny Betteridge claims the star may have spent up to $300,000 on various cosmetic procedures to achieve her stunning new look. Dr. Betteridge, founder of JB Aesthetics in London, shared his analysis in an Instagram video, listing potential enhancements including a facelift, upper eyelid surgery, a nose job, and a surgical brow lift. ‚ÄúShe most likely had some degree of surgical facelift done via an endoscopic approach, meaning it was minimally invasive,‚Äù he explained. Additional treatments allegedly include botox, lip fillers, a lip lift, and veneers, paired with laser resurfacing and a dermatologist-led skincare routine. Fans were quick to praise her transformation on social media. ‚ÄúShe looks amazing. I wish I had $200-$300K,‚Äù one user commented, while another said, ‚ÄúIncredible work! She looks fantastic.‚Äù A post shared by Dr Jonny Betteridge (@drjb.aesthetics) Lohan has attributed her refreshed glow to skincare. In an interview with Allure, the actress revealed her low-maintenance routine, including Av√®ne moisturizers, Peter Thomas Roth eye patches, and occasional laser treatments. ‚ÄúI just want to look at myself and love myself for who I am,‚Äù she shared. The actress, who has faced personal and legal challenges in the past, is now making a celebrated comeback. Her appearance at Paris Fashion Week in a black sequin dress was hailed as ‚Äúan iconic comeback‚Äù by style commentators.¬†Lohan is currently promoting her new Christmas movie, Our Little Secret, set to release on November 27.

Rebel Wilson's attempt to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the producers of her directorial debut,The Deb, has been denied by a Los Angeles Superior Court. Judge Thomas Long ruled that the actress‚Äôs claims of sexual harassment and embezzlement, made in an Instagram video and other contexts, do not qualify as protected free speech under California‚Äôs anti-SLAPP statute. The producers, Amanda Ghost, Gregor Cameron, and Vince Holden, allege that Wilson defamed them to gain creative control and force the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Wilson had previously accused the producers of inappropriate behavior toward the film‚Äôs lead actress and embezzling approximately AU $900,000 from the budget. However, lead actress Charlotte MacInnes denied these allegations, stating in court that Wilson‚Äôs claims were baseless and made her feel bullied by the director. While Wilson countersued in October, alleging theft, bullying, and harassment by the producers, her legal team plans to appeal the recent ruling. Camille Vasquez, attorney for the producers, commended the court‚Äôs decision, calling Wilson‚Äôs dismissal motion a ‚Äúcynical attempt‚Äù to suppress valid legal claims.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511805/jon-watts-cancels-wolfs-sequel-after-trust-issues-with-apple-tv,Jon Watts cancels Wolfs sequel after trust issues with Apple TV,"November 25, 2024","US Jon Watts canceled Wolfs sequel, citing Apple's surprise decision to shift from wide theatrical release to streaming. Jon Watts has revealed he scrapped plans for a sequel to Wolfs, starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, citing a loss of trust in Apple. The director explained that the studio‚Äôs last-minute decision to shift the original film from a wide theatrical release to a limited run followed by streaming led to his decision. Watts shared with Deadline that Apple initially praised his final cut of Wolfs and even commissioned a sequel. However, he was blindsided by the pivot to streaming, learning of the change less than a week before the public announcement. ‚ÄúApple didn‚Äôt cancel the sequel‚ÄîI did‚Äîbecause I no longer trusted them as a creative partner,‚Äù Watts stated. Despite his disappointment, he returned the sequel commission to avoid generating negative press during the film‚Äôs release. Watts also expressed frustration with Apple for ignoring his request to exclude the sequel announcement from their press release. ‚ÄúThey used it to create a positive spin on their streaming decision,‚Äù he said, emphasizing that the move came without explanation or discussion. While proud of Wolfs, Watts felt compelled to take a stand for creative transparency. His experience echoes a growing trend in the industry, exemplified by Doug Liman‚Äôs Road House debacle after Amazon acquired MGM. Liman, who had anticipated a theatrical release, saw the project shifted to streaming, which directly affected compensation for him and his team. ‚ÄúWe need streaming, but agreements must be honored,‚Äù Liman said in an interview. While Watts supports streaming as a medium, his experience highlights tensions between creative expectations and shifting studio priorities. Apple has yet to comment on the matter, but Watts‚Äô principled decision underscores the importance of trust in creative partnerships.

Glen Powell‚Äôs lookalike contest in Austin, Texas, on November 24, was as creative as the actor himself. The winner didn‚Äôt just receive bragging rights but was promised a cameo for their parent or family member in Powell‚Äôs upcoming film‚Äîa prize as unique as the event. Held at Auditorium Shores in Town Lake, the contest drew dozens of Powell‚Äôs lookalikes, but the actor couldn‚Äôt attend in person due to filming commitments in England for The Running Man. Despite his absence, Powell made his presence felt through a Facetime appearance, where he delivered a humorous video message packed with jokes and playful remarks. In his lighthearted video, Powell quipped that the contest was actually for This Is Us actor Justin Hartley‚Äôs lookalike and teased attendees about forming a ‚Äúcriminal Glen-Terprise‚Äù heist. ‚ÄúAnd we don‚Äôt need masks because we all have the same face: It‚Äôs the perfect crime,‚Äù he joked. He also challenged participants to fully commit to the bit, saying, ‚ÄúIf no one is shirtless for no reason, then this whole thing is a sham.‚Äù While his mother and aunt assisted in judging the contest, Powell ensured the highlight was his promise to the winner. He cheekily valued the prize at ‚Äú$6 billion,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúThe winner‚Äôs parent or family member will have a cameo in my next movie.‚Äù Celebrity lookalike contests have grown in popularity, with similar events held for stars like Timoth√©e Chalamet and Harry Styles.

Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs appeared upbeat as he entered a New York City courtroom for a bail hearing, hoping to secure his release while facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. The 55-year-old music mogul greeted his family with blown kisses and waves as he entered South Manhattan Federal Court, wearing a beige prison jumpsuit. Unlike previous hearings, he was not shackled and was escorted by US marshals. Family and supporters, including his mother Janice Combs, daughter Chance Combs, son Justin Dior Combs, and adopted son Quincy Brown, attended the hearing on Friday afternoon. The judge deferred the decision on granting him bail, following arguments from prosecutors that Combs could not be ‚Äútrusted‚Äù to follow conditions and might evade legal supervision even with his lawyers‚Äô guidance. Combs is currently detained on a $50 million bond at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, as he awaits his trial. During the hearing, Combs‚Äô legal team pointed to changed circumstances, including new evidence, as reasons to release him, arguing it would allow him to better prepare for his trial scheduled for May 5. Previously, two judges have ruled that he poses a danger to the community and is a flight risk. Assistant US Attorney Christine Slavik stated that Combs‚Äô attempts to contact witnesses from prison, often through family members, demonstrated that he ‚Äúcannot and will not follow rules‚Äù set by his own legal team. ‚ÄúSimply put, the defendant cannot be trusted,‚Äù she said. Slavik further accused Combs‚Äô lawyers of ‚Äúenabling his flouting of rules‚Äù and argued that they had shown an ‚Äúinability to control their client.‚Äù Last week, prosecutors alleged that Combs used jailmates‚Äô phones to intimidate potential witnesses ahead of his trial. According to court documents, he allegedly contacted family members from prison, asking them to reach out to potential victims and craft ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù while making ‚Äúrelentless efforts‚Äù to ‚Äúcorruptly influence witness testimony.‚Äù COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511799/pti-convoys-face-tear-gas-as-march-towards-islamabad-continues,PTI convoys face tear gas as march towards Islamabad continues,"November 25, 2024","US PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar says talks are underway. PTI convoys led by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Opposition leader, Omar Ayub, entered Punjab premises on the call of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan. The convoys, originating from the Hazara Interchange, are heading towards D-Chowk in Islamabad. As the convoys advanced, they encountered heavy resistance from the police at the Ghazi Brotha Bridge, where intense shelling was reported. Despite the police crackdown, Omar Ayub's convoy managed to push back Punjab Police forces at the Hazara Interchange. Ali Amin Gandapur, who is leading the Hazara Division convoy, played a crucial role in helping the convoy break through the police barricades. After overcoming the police blockade, the convoys continued their journey, with vehicles stretching over two kilometers as they moved forward. On the Hazara Motorway, PTI supporters successfully forced police to retreat, with reports of violent clashes and heavy stone-pelting. Several police personnel were injured in the scuffles, and two officers were severely wounded and transferred to hospitals. Among the injured officers were DSPs Chaudhry Zulfiqar and Shahid Gilani, as well as ASI Tabassum. DSP Zulfiqar suffered significant injuries to his back and legs during the confrontation. 'Talks underway' Barrister Gohar Khan and Saif held a 90-minute meeting with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi. Following the meeting, Barrister Gohar described the discussion as significant, confirming that Imran Khan‚Äôs call for a protest remains final and that rumors about it being canceled were untrue. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Barrister Gohar emphasised that the PTI founder‚Äôs stance on the protest was unchanged, and the movement would proceed as planned. The meeting focused on strategic discussions regarding the ongoing political situation and the party's future course of action. When asked about the ongoing negotiations surrounding the protest, Barrister Gohar assured reporters that updates would be provided in due course. He further confirmed that discussions were still ongoing but did not offer further details at this time. 'Final call' The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. Internet services suspension The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily and denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. Several leaders arrested A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised.

IShowSpeed‚Äôs adventurous 2024 streaming tour took a bruising turn in New Zealand when he stepped into the cage with UFC veteran Dan Hooker. Known for his bold personality, the streamer visited City Kickboxing, the renowned gym that has produced MMA superstars like Israel Adesanya and Kai Kara-France, but quickly learned the price of challenging an elite fighter. Walking into the gym with his signature confidence, Speed greeted trainers and up-and-coming athletes, declaring, ‚ÄúNobody in here can beat me at boxing.‚Äù After a brief sparring session with an amateur, which left him momentarily shaken, Speed adjusted the rules to better suit his strengths. However, his bravado was tested further when Dan Hooker, a 10-year UFC veteran with 24 wins, entered the cage. Speed, cautious about the UFC star‚Äôs capabilities, insisted, ‚ÄúNo kicking‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs do boxing.‚Äù What followed was a spectacle of endurance and humility. Speed tried to keep his distance, circling the edges of the octagon, but moments of hesitation allowed Hooker to capitalize. The Hangman dropped the streamer multiple times, laughing as he said, ‚ÄúWelcome to my world, brother.‚Äù When Speed protested about a weight difference, Hooker quipped, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lighter than you,‚Äù highlighting the uphill battle Speed faced. Clips of the match, including one where Speed was left clutching his ribs, quickly went viral, with fans praising his courage and laughing at his antics. After the match, Speed admitted, ‚ÄúHe got me good‚Ä¶ I could tell you were going easy on me.‚Äù Hooker returned the compliment on Instagram, calling Speed ‚Äúballs of steel.‚Äù While his UFC dreams may be out of reach, Speed‚Äôs resilience and charisma hint at a promising future in the influencer boxing realm.

When it comes to the world ofWicked, the costumes are just as magical as the story itself. Costume designer Paul Tazewell, known for his meticulous attention to detail, has crafted costumes that not only define the characters of Elphaba and Glinda but also contribute to the world-building of Oz. His journey into the world ofWickedwas shaped by a French picture book, which inspired him to create a visual world where every scene is as captivating as the last, down to the smallest details. Tazewell‚Äôs designs breathe life into the characters, giving depth and backstory through the clothes they wear.  Tracy Nguyen for The New York Times Elphaba‚Äôs earth-toned, textured wardrobe and Glinda‚Äôs glamorous, show-stopping dresses aren‚Äôt just about fabric‚Äîthey‚Äôre about storytelling. From the iconic pink bubble dress, a design requiring 137 pattern pieces and over 200 hours of hand-beading, to the intricately felted details of Elphaba's costume, every stitch is a part of a bigger narrative. Paul Tazewell brings more than three decades of experience in costume design, with accolades ranging from Broadway hits likeHamiltonandIn the Heightsto his film work onHarrietandWest Side Story. But it was his approach toWickedthat allowed him to blend his deep love of detail with a fresh, modern interpretation.  Paul Tazewell has spent more than 30 years designing costumes for theater. Image: Instyle Tazewell wanted the costumes to speak to a more expansive, reimagined version of the world of Oz, one that still felt grounded in its theatrical history but also distinctly his own. His meticulous work not only pays homage to the original Broadway costumes designed by Susan Hilferty but also reinterprets them to suit the needs of the film, ensuring the costumes fit perfectly into the cinematic version of this beloved tale. His work with the color palettes of Elphaba‚Äôs darker, nature-inspired wardrobe and Glinda‚Äôs lighter, airy look shows the evolution of their characters and their relationship. As Elphaba begins to find herself and grow more comfortable with her own power, her clothes shift from restrictive, turn-of-the-century shapes to more modern, freeing silhouettes.  Cynthia Erivo's costumes as Elphaba featured textural elements that were inspired by nature. Image: Universal Glinda‚Äôs journey also plays out through her fashion‚Äîher early, overly feminine looks evolve as her bond with Elphaba deepens, resulting in a blending of both characters' visual identities.  The bodice of Glinda's (played by Ariana Grande) bubble gown took 225 hours to hand-bead. Image: Universal Tazewell‚Äôs passion for detail extends beyond just the characters. The costumes, made by an extensive team of artisans, serve as an immersive experience that captures every nuance ofWicked's world. With over 60 costumes per lead character and a total of 140 crew members working across eight different workshops, Tazewell's vision comes to life in ways that are both stunning and intricate. His ability to weave the characters' emotional arcs into their clothing and his understanding of how the designs would resonate with the audience is what makes his work so remarkable.  The costumes for Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) featured magical iconography. Image: Universal The film‚Äôs approach toWickedisn‚Äôt about just re-creating past designs; it‚Äôs about evolving them into something new while retaining the magic that has made the characters so iconic. The challenge of blending the theatrical elements with the expansive world of film is one Tazewell embraces with confidence, bringing his creative vision to the forefront in a way that enhances the storytelling. Ultimately, Tazewell's work onWickedis about more than just creating beautiful costumes‚Äîit's about ensuring that every detail, from fabric to silhouette, adds to the narrative, bringing each character‚Äôs journey to life in the most magical way possible. The world of Oz feels alive through Tazewell‚Äôs designs, and it's a testament to his incredible talent and vision that every element ofWicked's costumes adds depth to the story. The world ofWickedfeels vast and boundless. The teamwork between Tazewell, Chu, Crowley, and everyone involved has brought to life something incredibly detailed, imaginative, rich, and exciting‚Äîso much so that you‚Äôll wish it could slow down, allowing you to fully appreciate every intricate detail, from the background characters to Jonathan Bailey‚Äôs Fiyero boots.

YouTuber Jeff Wittek has revealed undergoing a $90,000 eye surgery to address lingering injuries from a 2020 stunt involving fellow YouTuber David Dobrik. The incident occurred during a video shoot where Wittek was swung from an excavator operated by Dobrik. The stunt took a disastrous turn, leaving Wittek with extensive injuries, including a shattered skull, broken foot and hip, torn ligament, and nearly losing his eye.
