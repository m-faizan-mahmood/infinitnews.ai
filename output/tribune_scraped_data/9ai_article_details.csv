The 30-year-old sprinter had hinted earlier this year at the Paris Olympics that she would step away after earning gold, silver, and bronze medals in relay events, contributing to Australia's most successful Summer Games campaign. In a statement confirming her retirement, McKeon expressed mixed emotions, saying, ""I will definitely miss it... It‚Äôs brought me many great relationships and shaped who I am."" However, she added, ""I‚Äôm ready for the next chapter of my life, which I‚Äôm excited for. I haven‚Äôt yet had the chance to fully reflect on everything."" McKeon‚Äôs Olympic journey began in Rio 2016, where she won her first gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay, alongside two relay silvers and a bronze in the 200m freestyle. Her performance at Tokyo 2021 cemented her legacy, with victories in the 100m and 50m freestyle sprints, two relay golds, and three bronze medals ‚Äì the largest medal haul by any athlete at those Games. Australia's swimming coach Rohan Taylor praised McKeon, calling her ""a great role model for younger athletes"" and highlighting her resilience. ""While everyone witnessed her grace, they couldn‚Äôt fully see how tough she is,"" Taylor remarked. Swimming Australia CEO and McKeon‚Äôs uncle, Rob Woodhouse, alongside Taylor, described her victory in the 100m freestyle in Tokyo as a career highlight. In a thrilling race, McKeon edged out Hong Kong‚Äôs Siobhan Haughey by just 0.31 seconds. ""It was one of the greatest races I‚Äôve ever seen,"" Woodhouse commented, also commending McKeon for mentoring younger swimmers. In addition to her six Olympic golds and five world titles, McKeon was part of relay teams that set eight world records, three of which still stand. Reflecting on her journey, McKeon recalled missing out on the London Olympics as a teenager but used that experience to inspire others. ""You have ups and downs, but you keep going and ticking the boxes,"" she said. ""I hope my story shows young athletes that I was once in their position ‚Äì dreaming of achieving something big.""

Baseball, deeply rooted in Taiwanese culture since its introduction during Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945), is among the nation's most beloved sports. The team secured a decisive 4-0 win against Japan in the final at Tokyo Dome on Sunday, sparking widespread celebrations across Taiwan. President Lai Ching-te praised the players in a phone call shared on Instagram, thanking them for bringing pride to Taiwan and showcasing the island‚Äôs achievements beyond its renowned semiconductor industry. Lai also announced that the team would be greeted at the presidential office following their arrival. Defence Minister Wellington Koo, who watched the match at home, described the victory as a historic moment, adding that the fighter jet salute was a fitting gesture to honour the team's achievement. Large crowds gathered in Taiwan to watch the final on outdoor screens, while businesses and restaurants marked the occasion with special discounts. Some companies, including Trend Micro, declared Monday a holiday in celebration. Taiwan participated in the championship under the name ""Chinese Taipei,"" a designation used in most international sporting events to sidestep political tensions with China, which claims the island as its territory. The naming issue has been a contentious topic in Taiwan, with some advocating for the use of ""Taiwan"" in international competitions. A 2018 referendum rejected such a proposal, citing fears that it could provoke China to block the island‚Äôs participation in global events. In Tokyo, Taiwanese fan Wang Ming-chang expressed hope for change, saying, ""Taiwan is our country, and we want to compete under the name of Taiwan in international events. That‚Äôs our ultimate goal."" COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511746/kurram-rivals-agree-to-cease-fire-for-7-days,Kurram rivals agree to cease fire for 7 days,"November 25, 2024","PK Govt Jirga brokers deal for return of prisoners and bodies An official Jirga on Sunday negotiated a ceasefire between the warring tribesmen in the Kurram district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), as the death toll from the three days of violence rose to 82, according to the officials in the provincial capital and the embattled district. K-P Information Minister Muhammad Ali Saif said in a statement that a government delegation flew in to Parachinar, Kurram's main town, and met with the rival leaders on Saturday and Sunday to try to broker a ceasefire deal and then move to resolve the matter. The government Jirga had returned to Peshawar from Kurram and ""there have been positive developments in engagements with stakeholders,"" Saif said. ""Both sides have agreed to a ceasefire for seven days and return each other's prisoners and bodies,"" he added. Armed groups in Kurram have been engaged in tribal rivalry for decades over a land dispute in the district located near the Afghanistan border. The latest wave of clashes was triggered after gunmen attacked convoys of civilian vehicles on Thursday, killing dozens of passengers. The roadside pogrom sparked retaliatory attacks against local residents and there have been pitched battles between armed groups from both sides. Armed groups attacked settlements that were populated by members of rival groups. According to the latest information obtained from the local police sources, 12 more people were killed in firing incidents in the district overnight, raising the death toll from clashes to 31 in the last 24 hours, and to 75 in the last three days. However, other media reports put the death toll even higher. ""The clashes and convoy attacks on November 21, 22, and 23 have resulted in 82 fatalities and 156 injuries,"" a local administration official told AFP, while speaking on condition of anonymity. Last night, clashes continued in Bagan, Alizai, Balshakhel, Khar Kalay, Maqbal and Kunj Alizai. The fighting intensified when armed groups of the Turi tribe burned and looted the Lower Kurram villages of Kalu Kunj, Badshah Kot and Bagan Bazaar. In the district, many homes had been evacuated, while markets and schools remain closed. A number of petrol stations had also been set alight, the officials said, adding that gunfights with both light and heavy weapons continued into the night. However, no fresh casualties were reported on Sunday morning. ""The mobile network across Kurram remains suspended and traffic on the main highway is halted,"" said another official. ""Our priority today is to broker a ceasefire between both sides. Once that is achieved, we can begin addressing the underlying issues,"" K-P Law Minister Aftab Alam Afridi told AFP.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511745/three-more-polio-cases-confirmed-1,Three more polio cases confirmed,"November 25, 2024","PK Three more polio cases confirmed In a troubling development, three more polio cases have emerged, taking the total number of polio cases reported so far in the country to 55. The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) has confirmed the detection of three wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases. These cases have emerged from DI Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Zhob and Jaffarabad districts of Balochistan. In DI Khan and Zhob, female children are affected while in Jaffarabad the crippling disease has attacked a male child. DI Khan, one of the seven polio endemic districts of southern K-P, has so far reported six polio cases, while this is the third case this year from Zhob and second from Jaffarabad. Pakistan is responding to an intense resurgence of WPV1 this year. Of the 55 cases reported so far, 26 are from Balochistan, 14 from the K-P, 13 from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Islamabad. Polio is a paralyzing disease that has no cure. Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five are essential to provide children high immunity against this disease. The Pakistan Polio Programme conducts multiple mass vaccination drives in a year, bringing the vaccine to children at their doorsteps, while the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) provides vaccinations against 12 childhood diseases free of charge at health facilities every year. Considering the intense polio outbreak, it is crucial for parents to ensure vaccination for all their children under the age of five to keep them protected.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511744/china-pushes-to-ease-pak-afghan-tensions,China pushes to ease Pak-Afghan tensions,"November 25, 2024","IN Top Chinese diplomat visits Kabul days after Islamabad briefing on TTP threat China seems to have launched a fresh diplomatic effort aimed at defusing brewing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan over the terrorist sanctuaries that Kabul has yet to dismantle despite Islamabad's repeated demands. Following a visit to Islamabad, a top Chinese diplomat dealing with Afghanistan travelled to Kabul over the weekend to meet with the Taliban leadership. China's Special Envoy for Afghanistan Yue Xiaoyong held talks with Afghan Deputy Prime Minister for Political Affairs Maulvi Abdul Kabir, Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub and others. His visit to Kabul came days after he was briefed by authorities in Islamabad on the threat posed by the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other militant groups operating from Afghan soil. Sources said Pakistan conveyed to the envoy that without addressing the terror threat, bilateral relations with Kabul would not move forward. It is believed that the visit of the Chinese envoy to Kabul and Islamabad was part of Beijing's latest push to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. China has in the past attempted to mediate between the estranged countries on the TTP issue, though those efforts yielded no progress. Beijing is worried about the fallout of escalating Pakistan-Afghanistan hostilities on its regional ambitions for greater connectivity and trade. Besides, the persistent presence of terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan also threatens Beijing's interests. Chinese nationals have come under terror attacks in Pakistan. This year at least 7 Chinese nationals were killed in two different terrorist attacks. Pakistan's investigations into the March 26 Besham terrorist attack concluded that there was a network connected to TTP was behind the attack. The probe also revealed that the suicide bomber was an Afghan national and the vehicle used in the attack was smuggled into Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan believes Baloch terrorist groups are now closely working with the TTP and also have their training camps in Afghanistan. However, unlike other countries, China usually follows a carefully crafted policy where such concerns are conveyed from behind closed doors. Officials here believe that they have this understanding that the Chinese envoy forcefully raised the issue of terrorist sanctuaries with the Afghan leadership. A statement issued by the Afghan Deputy Prime Minister's Office indicated that Pakistan, and Afghanistan relationship was one of the subjects of discussions. According to the statement, Mr Yue Xiaoyong commended Afghanistan's progress over the past three years and stressed the significance of fostering improved relations and mutual understanding among Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China. The reference to Pakistan, Afghanistan and China, according to observers, shows that Beijing is keen to see issues between Islamabad and Kabul are sorted out. The Afghan deputy prime minister told the Chinese envoy that the Islamic Emirate has consistently guaranteed its neighbours and the international community that Afghanistan poses no threat to any nation and has upheld this assurance over the past three years. ""The Deputy Prime Minister further noted that Afghanistan is transitioning from a prolonged period of conflict and is prioritizing the revitalisation of its national economy and the expansion of regional cooperation,"" according to the readout, which suggests that the Afghan side tried to placate concerns of China and Pakistan.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511743/pm-tasks-speakers-to-address-ppp-concerns,PM tasks speakers to address PPP concerns,"November 25, 2024","PL PM tasks speakers to address PPP concerns Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has instructed the speakers of the National Assembly and Punjab provincial assembly to take steps to address the concerns raised by the PPP, a party that has been propping up the PML-N led coalition government without actually becoming a part of it. The directive came on Sunday during a consultative session held in Lahore attended by NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan. According to officials, the participants reviewed the current political situation while also discussing the PPP's grievances as well as the PTI's protest march which left for Islamabad on Sunday, raising concerns about potential political instability. On November 22, PM Shehbaz established an 11-member committee after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari voiced frustration over the PML-N leadership's approach to coalition governance. The committee, including Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, and Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Khan Cheema, was tasked with facilitating ""political cooperation and conflict resolution"" between the parties. According to a statement issued from the PM's Office, the committee would work with PPP representatives to outline a path forward through dialogue. Earlier, on Saturday, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, who belongs to the PPP, urged the PM to intervene in order to resolve the differences between the two parties, which have a long history of political confrontation. During his meeting with Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar, the governor had also urged the PML-N led Punjab government to honor its commitment with the PPP, stating that the committee formed by the two parties to resolve issues have yielded no results. Khan said a functional coalition between the PML-N and the PPP would be beneficial for the country, warning that if the coalition government fails, it would primarily harm the PML-N, which currently leads the government. Last week, Bilawal had criticized the PML-N led federal government for failing to honor commitments to the PPP. He alleged that the PML-N government had not consulted with the PPP on policy matters such as the recent crackdown against the Virtual Private Networks (VPNs and restrictions imposed on internet access. He had also expressed concern about the proposed amendments to the IRSA Act to pave the way for construction of more canals on the River Indus.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2511742/defiant-pti-marchers-knock-on-capital-door,Defiant PTI marchers knock on capital door,"November 25, 2024","PK Clashes reported from Attock bridge  hundreds arrested The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) embarked on a collision course with the government on Sunday as it finally started marching toward the federal capital after refusing to call off the 'final' protest call given by the imprisoned party founder Imran Khan for his release, among other things. The routes leading to the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi have been closed with containers and heavy contingents of the law-enforcement agencies (LEA) personnel were deployed to meet any eventuality. The PTI rallies from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) led by Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, as well as from different cities of Punjab, began advancing towards the D-Chowk ‚Äì located right in front of the Parliament House in the Red Zone of the federal capital. A large PTI procession from K-P entered Punjab from the Attock bridge, Chach Interchange and Ghazi Barotha Canal. The convoy of vehicles stopped at Ghazi for a while, where Chief Minister Gandapur and Bushra Bibi, wife of Imran Khan, addressed the supporters urging them to move forward. When another convoy, coming from Haripur, reached the Attock Bridge, the police resorted to tear gas shelling. The protesters, meanwhile, set fire to the green belts around them, while a Suzuki van parked at Ghazi Bridge was also torched. A policeman was injured when directly hit by a motorcycle rider. The PTI, after entering Punjab, changed its strategy and directed the convoys coming from the Hazara Division, which had reached Taxila under the leadership of Omar Ayub, to join Gandapur-led convoy. Clashes were also reported from the Isakhel Interchange in Dera Ismail Khan. The PTI gave its final call for the protest to meet its four demands: release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, restoration of democracy and Constitution in the country and return of allegedly ""stolen mandate"". The demands surfaced on November 13 after Imran had urged people via a post on X, formerly Twitter, to reach Islamabad and not to return until those were met. The PTI had said that its rallies would be converted into a sit-in in the federal capital and end only when the demands were met. Since then, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government, backed by a recent order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), has been stating that neither the protestors would be allowed to enter the capital nor any leniency would be shown to them this time around. In anticipation of a possible head-on collision between the authorities and the protesters and in view of the visit by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, the government decided to place containers to block all the main arteries leading to Islamabad. The blockade has brought the twin cities as well as several other cities in Punjab to a standstill. A surprising decision was the sudden beginning of the repair work on different motorways. Besides, the government also shut down the internet in several areas. The interior ministry had already announced a day ago that WiFi and mobile internet services would be suspended in areas with ""security concerns"" but it would remain operational in the rest of the country. Nevertheless, internet tracking monitor Netblocks said WhatsApp backends were restricted in Pakistan. The decision was part of the government's strategy to block communication ahead of the planned protests. Amid this, both sides remained steadfast, refusing to back down until achieving their objectives. Before the march began, the federal and Punjab governments imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)¬óa legal measure enabling district administrations to ban public gatherings temporarily¬óand denied PTI permission to hold the protest. Nevertheless, PTI took to the streets, with Gandapur leading the march from the party's stronghold in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, joined by the provincial leadership, workers, supporters, and Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi. Though the caravans had entered Punjab, they were unlikely to reach Islamabad by Sunday night. In a brief address to workers in Swabi, Gandapur urged them to press forward and not retreat until Imran Khan's release, calling on protesters to use all their strength to clear the path to the federal capital. As the PTI convoy reached the Punjab boundary, the police started shelling on them at the Attock Bridge, Chach interchange and Ghazi Barotha canal areas. Later, Gandapur directed the convoy to stop at Ghazi Maqam for a while, urging the workers to get ready, because there was a ""battle ahead"". Meanwhile, it was reported that Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, also addressed the workers and asked them to quickly move ahead in their vehicles instead of walking along the march, stressing they would have to move fast and shouldn't come back without bringing Imran Khan back. While the K-P saw the largest mobilisation of the participants, the rallies also set out from various parts of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. In Punjab, opposition supporters marched from cities, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Mianwali, Kasur, Okara, and Vehari, among others. Despite heavy police and Rangers' deployment, many PTI workers managed to breach barricades and evade restrictions, in an attempt to reach the capital. Throughout the day, the PTI workers and LEA officials kept clashing in different parts of Punjab. A media report suggested that several PTI leaders, including PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar and Zain Qureshi were arrested from Multan. Reports attributed to the Punjab police spokesperson said that around 600 people had been arrested for violating Section 144 in Punjab. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi promised on Sunday to restrict protestors outside Islamabad. Naqvi took an aerial view of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock to review security arrangements in the three cities. He expressed satisfaction with the arrangements. Naqvi stated that necessary measures had been taken to ensure peace and public order in compliance with the IHC's order. He added that police and paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and Rangers were diligently performing their duties. The government had taken all possible measures to protect the lives and property of the citizens and that strict action would be taken against ""miscreants"" in accordance with the law, the interior minister emphasised. He made it clear that no one would be allowed to disrupt the law and order in the capital, and that the administration, police, and LEAs were prepared to deal with any possible situation. He mentioned that Belarus president's visit was crucial in strengthening relationship between the two countries.
